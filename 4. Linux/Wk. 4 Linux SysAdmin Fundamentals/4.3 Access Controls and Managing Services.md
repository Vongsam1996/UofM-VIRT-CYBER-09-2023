**Access Control**
- Grant Permission to access documents and files on a host 

**Item:** Linux categorizes files, programs and directories (Everything is an item and they belong to someone)
- **Owner:** Typically the user who created the item 
	- This can be changed
	- Each item has permission set
- **Group:** Typically the primary group associated with the creator 
	- Can be changed
	-  Group is associated with the item
- **Other:** Everyone who is not owner and not in the group

**How can we assign permission to objects in Linux?**
Files, 

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Assigning these permissions
	**Discretionary**: items permission can pass from one subject to another 

![[4.3.1.jpg]]

![[4.3.2.jpg]]
ls -l my_file.txt 
![[4.3.8.jpg]]
- '-' = item type 
- rw = Owner permission read and write 
- r - - : group permission (read)

![[4.3.3.jpg]]
- rwx: user can read, write, and execute
	- For owners ()
- rw-: Group can read and write
	- For group people (read only)
- r --: Others can read
	- For everyone 

![[4.3.4.jpg]]
- chmod 777 my_file.txt 
	- Everyone have access to my_file.txt

chmod 764
- Owner: read, write, execute
- Group: can only read and write
- Everyone else: Only read 

**Changing ownership**
ls -l my_file.txt
chown user:group my_file.txt
- chown root:root my_file.txt

Check the file: ls -l /etc/shadow
- Note: Root = Owner, shadow = group
1. sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
	- ls -l /etc/shadow
2. sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
	1. ls -l /etc/gshadow
3. sudo chmod 644 /etc/group
	1. ls -l /etc/shadow

**Managing Service**:
**Servers:** Computers that offers services to other computers
- Ex: File-sharing services allow computers to send and receive data 
	- Tripwire, only run locally on the servers and are not provided to other computers
	- These services are packages that can be installed and removed just like other programs 

**Services and security**
- Attackers can manipulate services into doing things that they are not designed to do
- SAMBA (example of SMB)
	- File-sharing tool that uses the SMB prtoocol, allows users to view, download, and store files remotely

SMB are software servers that is able to gain access to shard folder
- They can; exfiltrate, alter, or delete sensitive files

![[4.3.12.jpg]]

1. systemctl -t service --all
	1. systemctl: cmd looking at the services/ programs
	2. -t : type 
	3. service: What type is looking for 
	4. -- all: Look at all service type 
2. . systemctl -t service --all | less | grep smbd 
	1. less: look at files slowly
	2. grep: Choosing text you arte looking for 
	3. smbd: can be any services you want to find, smb =Samba 
3. sudo systemctl stop smbd 
	1. NOTE: Stopping samba

Starting a services when lauching computer/ system
- sudo systemctl enable smbd 
	- enable - allow the system to pop up when resetting computer/system 

Looking for active smbd
- systemclt status smbd

Starting smbd
- sudo systemclt start smbd

apt 
- installing packaging

**Service Users**
Service users are dedicated to running their own specific service 
![[4.3.13.jpg]]

root - User
x - Password
0 group id
0 group 

root:/bin/bash: can interact with users

nologin: no one can login in

look group id
sudo less /etc/shadow

**Adding a users (looking for user ftp)**
sudo less .etc shadow
cat /etc/shadow | grep ftp

cat /etc/shadow | passwd | grep ftp

View mutiple users grep 

cat /etc/shadow | passwd | grep 'ftp\|dove'

**Delete user**
sudo deluser --remove-all-files "[user]"

**Add system user**
sudo adduser --system--no-create-home [username]
: --system: sysadmin (UID: <1000)
-- no-create-home: No user in home  

sudo adduser --system [username]
- This will create Username in /home 
- Also making this person sysadmin 

sudo deluser --remove-all-files [user]

id = show group 

**How to add a user to a group**
sudo usermod -G [Group name] [username]

id 

**Adding a group**
sudo addgroup [group name]

NOTE: /bin/bash 
- Can use cmd but not sysadmin

![[4.3.14.jpg]]
- sam does not have a password ! ....\
- matt has a password $....
	- This is a password hash

**Add user to groupgroup**
sudo groupadd class group
sudo usermod -G class group matt 
sudo usermod -aG class group sam
- -aG add user and keep them in all other groups 
- -G add user BUT delete that person in everyone else
