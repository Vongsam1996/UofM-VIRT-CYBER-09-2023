**Windows**
![[7.1.0.jpg]]
- We are going to learn "Windows way" of performing basic sysadmin 
- Windows is the most popular so many hackers learn windows

Launching your windows lab 
- We are using Azure Lab Environment 

Introduction to task manager
Task Manager: Windows tools for trouble shooting resource usage 
- Programs left running while not in use can take up excessive resources or even allow for unwanted remote connection 
- *Blue screen of death*: Processes can even cause memory leaks that can result in system instability and abrupt system crash 

Launching task manager
ctrl +shift + esc 

**Instructor Demonstration**

- Program files and Program Files (x86) is where downloaded files will be here
	- These are the most watch location 
- Temp is another targeted files because no one check it 
- User can show where is the password 


**Environment variable (envvars)**: Special values that contain information about the system, such as the user's home directory or the system's program file directory 
![[7.1.5.jpg]]
cd %Userprofile%/documents
- It will direct them to the document of user they are on 

cd %userprofile%
- this will take you home 

%userprofiles/desktop
- sends you to desktop 

![[7.1.8.jpg]]
-Cmd prompts are not case sensitive with files and directories 
	-cd "Program files" is the same as cd "PROGRAMS FILES"
	- quotes around the name of files or directory that contain space
cls
- it will clear the cmd 

%cd% 
- pwd in linux

**Activity: Intro to task Manager and CMD**
![[7.1.12.jpg]]
![[7.1.13.jpg]]
1. Ctlr + Shift + esc
2. Start up tab
3. Run `cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop` to navigate into the directory where we will create our report. We'll create the report in the next step.
- goes to desktop 
4. Run `echo Baselining Report > report.txt` to create a report titled `report.txt`.
- this will create a text file called report 
5. Run `echo Created by [your name here] >> report.txt` to add the subtitle.
- Create text saying: Created by sam in report.txt
6.  Run `echo %OS% system report created on %DATE% with logged in user, %USERNAME%. >> report.txt`
	- Run `type report.txt`



____
**Windows Management Instrumentation Command (wmic)** 
**Windows Management Instrumentation Command (wmic)**: A tool used to query system information and diagnostics, such as OS and hard disk info
- Sysadmin can also use wmic to launch, terminate, install, and uninstall processes 

![[7.1.10.jpg]]
**[global switches]** : not normal switches; wmic-specific global commands that alter behavior 
- Can do things like specify a file to append output to 
- cmd /APPEND:files name
	- This will append or send 
	- It is similar to linux >>
	- you can still use > in windows 
	- 

[Alias] is the windows component that wmic queries
- Common aliases includes
	- os(operating system): contains properties specifc to the operating system, such as the windows edition name and build number
	- Logicaldisk: Contains properties specific to the disk drives, such as drive name, file system, free space, size, and volume serials number
[Verbs] are actions we want to complete with the wmic command
- example: wmic os to find operating system information, we can then use the m get verb, followed by the various [properties] we want to find 

[Properties] 
	-common properties to retrieve using get
		-Get caption: Returns an one-line description of the given alias
		- Gets all of the properties and values of an alias and lists each on a separate line

**Users and Password Policies**

![[7.1.15 1.jpg]]
- add a user that give itself administrator and remote desktop user
- This will be noisy 

net is used to mange user accounts, groups, and passwords policies 
![[7.1.14.jpg]]
$net user 
- list all users

$net local groups 
- List all groups

$net accounts
- see passwords and login requirements

Example of net localgroups
$net  localgorup

shows all groups 
- If you are hacking then look for remote users and administrators 
- power users is the second best 
	- Can still run some commands 
- backup operations
	- can add users but can not wipe users
	- Add yourself into a backup 


example of net accounts 
$net accounts
![[7.1.17.jpg]]
- 42 dats will tell you when your password will expired 
- Lockout threshold: how many time you failed to sign in before a lock out 
- Lockout duration: will tell you how long it will stop the sign in period
- minimum password length: requirement to add a password

Net user example
$net user evilme password Password!! /add
- add user named evilme 
	- with password of Password!! 

$net localgroup "Administrators" evilme /add
- add evil me into administrator 

$net user evilme 
- It will show info about the user 
![[7.1.18.jpg]]

Same as sudo 
runas /env /user:user@domain.microsoft.com 

![[7.1.19.jpg]]
1. Enumerate user with net user
$net user >> report.txt
2. Find `Alex`'s password status:
$net user Alex >> report.txt
3. Find groups on the machine:
$net localgroup >> report.txt
4. Find the current password policy:
$net accounts >> report.txt
5. Run `type report.txt` to see the updated report.
$type report.txt

**Task Scheduling (Optional/ time permitting)**
**Task scheduler** : A GUI tool that allows system administrators to automate the execution of scripts and application on a windows system 
- Scheduling task to automate certain task
