- Snort is the wolrd's most popular open source network IDS/IPS
___
**Alert: C2 Beacon**
![[11.3.3.jpg]]
C2 servers are used to create a specfic type of alert for attacks that use persistence as part of their attack campaigns 
- Infected hosts make callbacks to C2 server 
- Callback (Keep alive) serve as beacons that keep the back channel open to enable access in and out of the network at all times 
	- IE -> Dst Ip and  Event message

NOTE: C2 can take control of their victim's computer (terminal)
- Command and control (C2 or Cnc)
- Note they can control multiple computers 
- Controlled computers are called **Zombies**

![[11.3.2.jpg]]
Writer of Snort rules can include a reference URL in the Snort rule option 
- Snort rules can include links to help network defenders establish TTPS regarding their attackers
- Network Defenders can form mitigation strategies to help improve their security posture

____
**OSSEC and ESM (Enterprise security monitoring**
ESMs use OSSEC to provide visibility at the host level, where malware infection takes place after it's decrypted 
- OSSEC is used host-based IDS (HIDS)
- Many configuration option and can be tailored to the needs of any organization 

**Endpoint telemetry**: Essentially a host-based monitoring of system data
- Monitoring data in the system
- ELASTIC Tool -> It can control/ collect data from multiple tools 
	- Can check their logs and their metrics 
		- Metrics: Look at CPU/ Memory 
			- Can see if someone is trying to DoS or downloading virus 
	- This is using OSSEC

OSSEC agents are deployed syslog data 
- Generate alerts that are sent to the centralized server security onion 
- Security administrator can then use Security Onion to form a detailed understanding of the situation and reconstruct a crime 

NOTE: OSSEC detect infections 

**Elastic stack (ELK)**
OSSEC monitors syslog data, but security admin use three other important tools to fully analyze packet capture 
- Elasticsearch +logsearch + Kibana 

![[11.3.5.jpg]]
1. OSSEC generates an alert 
2. OSSEC sends alert data gathered from syslog to Security Onion's OSSEC server 
3. The OSSEC-generated syslog alert is written to Log stash for storage
4. Log data is ingested into the Elasticsearch analytics engine, which parses  hundreds of thousands of data points to prepare for data presentation
5. Users interact with data through the Kibana web interface.

**ESM Tool**
To investigate a network security breach
- Squert
	- Not Cosumnes friendly 
- Kibana
	- Can also work as well 

Junior analyst belong to multi-tier group of analyst 
Junior analysts typically perform the initial triage of alerts and the escalate these events to senior incident responders 
___
**Instruction Demo: Investigation, Analysis, and Escalation**
Squert 
- Advance -> Sign in 
![[11.3.15.jpg]]
- these links -> Interact with link 

![[11.3.16.jpg]]
- This is under the view tab above
- Thicker the line = more traffic/ data transfer
	- Thicker line does not mean bad => It can mean you are interacting with the public 
		- 172.16.150.20 (Public -> is not shown above)
			- You can see how much data is being transfer by hovering over the IP
NOTE: If you see some website/ ipadress with high traffic 
- It does not mean there is a malware 
- Go to firewall and prevent that Ip address 

Kibana
In SGUIL
Right click Dst Ip -> Kibana
