DHCP
- How IP Address is able to connect to websites
	- SYN, SYN/AWK, AWK
NAT
- Way to map multiple private address inside a local network to public IP Address 

**DNS Record Types**
**Domain Name System(DNS) **: Phone book of the internet 
- Which is why we can enter google.com instead of 64.233.177.139
	- Type of DNS Record is translation of a domain to an IP ADDRESS 
- DNS needs to provide other detail about a domain 
	- EX: When you send an email, your email server needs to find the mail server name from the domain receiving the email
		- Details are provided but the many other DNS record type 
			- PC - send email -> Find mail server name - Receive email-> PC

**DNS zone File:** Actual file containing all the DNS record for a particular domain 
- Lives in a DNS 
- DNS zone files contain a **Time to Live (TTL)** indicating how long a **DNS cache** will remember the information in the file before having to request an updated copy from the DNS server 
- DNS zone file also contains the DNS records with information about the domain

CNAME - Alias 


![[9.2.2.jpg]]

**NS Record** (Name server)
**Domain**
- Have multiple Name server (NS) record for redundancy 
	- One fails another is available 
- Ex: Widget.com has two server containing its DNS record 
	- ns1.dnscompany.com
	- ns2.dnscompany.com

**Subdomain**
- NS records can be also  be used to point subdomains to name servers 
- Ex: 
	- We can point the subdomain **Marketing.widgets.com** to a DNS server of ns3.dnscompany.com 

**DNS Records and Email Communication**
**MX Record (mail exchange)**: Directs emails to a specific mail server for a domain 
- Ex MX Record
	- widgets.com has mail server called mailhost.widgets.com
		- If email is sent to bob@widgets.com -> Sender will valiadate that the MX record for widgets.com is mailhost.widgets.com
		- Sender then directs the email to the mail server mailhost.widgets.com 
	- Like NS record, domains can have multiple MX records for redundancy, in case one goes down or can not handle a large amount of traffic
![[9.2.3.jpg]]

**TXT Record**
**TXT Record (text):** Created to include human-readable notes, such as associated company name 
- These also include computer-readable data 
- Ex: Computer-readable TXT data is the **SPF record** (Sender policy framework), which determines if an email is from a trusted server 
	- An SPF record indicates which mail servers are allows to send emails on behalf of a domain 
	- An SPF records main purpose is to prevent spam, Phishing, and Email spoofing, by detecting emails that may have a forget sender email

**SPF**
![[9.2.4.jpg]]
EX of how SPF Record works: 
- Widgets.com's DNS SPF record indicates that 23.43.54.235 and 23.43.54.236 are the IP addresses of mail servers allowed to send emails on its behalf 
	- gadgets.com received a suspicious email from a widgets.com email
		- When the receiving email server at gadgets.com receives the email, it completes the following steps 
		1. Check the sending mail server's IP address 12.54.54.23
		2. Validates the DNS record of widget.com's SPF record to confirm the sending mail server's IP address is either 23.43.54.235 or 23.43.54.236
		3. Since the sender’s IP is 12.54.54.23 (not 23.43.54.235 or 23.43.54.236), gadgets.com's mail server can identify the email as spam and potentially reject it or send it to the recipient's spam folder.

**nslookup (name server lookup)** allows us to easily look up the DNS records of any domain 
![[9.2.5.jpg]]
- mx record -> Emails 

____
Instructor Demo: nslookup walkthrough
![[9.2.12.jpg]]
Server/ address: What it used to search up 
- Server -> 8.8.8.8 google (Private server) 
- Server -> Can have your own private server number

![[9.2.15.jpg]]
Looking address from certain email
ns lookup 
- > set type=mx
-  > domain name

Non-authoritative answer;
Tell you what MX record they have and their priority 
- mail exchanger -> It is the priority -> Lower the number the higher the priority 

It is to check if the email IP Address is the same from other email 

Example of legit checking emails 
![[9.2.16.jpg]] ![[9.2.17.jpg]]
- to check if the highlighted is real -> The menards.com is not an mistake 

![[9.2.18.jpg]]
- SPF will tell you who can send email 
	- it will tell you what pass or not -> It is legit if pass 
Note: This is known as email headers

**Introduction to Email Networking**
![[9.2.8.jpg]]
**Step 1:**
- - Bob, whose email is Bob@bob.com, composes an email to send to Alice, whose email is Alice@alice.com
- Once Bob clicks Send, the email is forwarded to Bob’s company’s email server
The email server is also referred to as the **MTA  (mail transfer agent)**

**Step 2**
- Bob’s mail server does a DNS lookup against alice.com to determine its mail server.
- Bob’s mail server gets this information from alice.com’s MX record.**

**Step 3**
- Using a protocol called SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), Bob’s mail server sends the email to Alice’s mail server
- SMTP uses port 25 and is part of Layer 7: Application of the OSI model. 

PORT 5 USE SMTP 

**Step 4**
- Bob’s email is currently sitting on Alice’s email server, and Alice needs to pull it from this server in order to read it.
- Two protocols can be used to transfer the email to Alice’s local computer: POP3 and IMAP
	- One POP3 or IMAP will save the files/ emails 

**POP 3** vs **IMAP**

**Other header/fields**
WIthin email - there are three vertical bubbles -> Show original 
- **Delivered- to:** Specifics the recipient's emails 
- **Return-path:**  Specifies the sender's return emails 
- **Received:** Show a list of mail servers, illustrating the path taken by the email from its source to destination
	- Source IP Address -> Nslookup -> Look up Ip address and see if they are trusted
- **Message-ID**: Unique string created by the sending mail server as an identifier of the email
	- They will let you know if it is pass or fail -> EVEN IF IT PASS -> Check everything
- **Received SPF**: The SPF verification field
![[9.2.13.jpg]]
grabitfied -> It is created a link that shows where their location

Note: we look at the last domain in Message -ID

![[9.2.30.jpg]]
- Return path name is suspious and yahoo is a public email 
- This is not a good email but we can not discard it 
	- Michael Smith is suspious

![[9.2.31.jpg]]

- Return path
- Message Id 
- received-SPF failed
	- IP Address can be different 

This is Spam -> Send them to garbage 
![[9.2.32.jpg]]
Received-SPF failed 
return-path: return@irs.org
Received: Thought.bestwebsitesabc.com
to: there is multiple people 

![[9.2.33.jpg]]
- message-ID: mail.gmail.com -> other people can send gmail to send private emails
	- This is okay, gmail is a trusted user
	- It is usually a ugly number
Return path: We want to make this this is not suspious

**Email Security Issue**
Over 60% emails identify as spam 
- It is not inherently dangerous 
- Methods involve using SPF records, matching lists of known spam senders, and keywords identification 
![[9.2.34.jpg]]
**Email Spoofing** When and email is designed to trick the receiver into believing it is coming from a trust source

Email security Issue: Email Spoofing**
Can be detected by raw email header in sent emails;
1. The *From* email header
2. the *Received-SPF* Email Header
3. the *Received* Email header 

**Method 1:  The *From* email header**
Spammers and phishers often disguise their true source email, changing the displayed email source to a name the recipient will trust or recognize
![[9.2.19.jpg]]

**Method 2: *Received-SPF* Email Header**
**Received-SPF**: is an email header that displays the results of validating the SPF record 
- Uses the IP address from the Received field and determines if its an IP of an authorized sender 
![[9.2.22.jpg]]

NOTE: Received header includes the source IP of the mail server that sent the email

**Method 3: The *Received* Email Header**
Many web tools availavle to look up IP address information 
- EX: https://search.arin.net/rdap/ 
	- isn't always the simplest way to validate a legitimate email sender
		- used by security professionals to provide additional information about senders 
![[9.2.23.jpg]]

Note: Email systems have built-in technologies that automate methods to identify and detect spoofed and phishing email 

google search
whoami [Ip address number]
- Will tell you information about the ip address from phishing email.
