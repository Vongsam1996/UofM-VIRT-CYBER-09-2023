 **Why Linux**
Unix refers to *Linux* and *Linux-like* operating system 
- ubiquity of linux machines on modern networks makes its common target for attackers 

![[4.1.0.jpg]]
**Activity 1:**

**Operating system**: (OS) software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals. 
- Linux = Free, Open, Source, Software (FOSS)
	- Unlike Mac and Windows where they are not FOSS
	- FOSS meaning, anyone can modify the source code 


**Distributions**
**Distribution:** Special -purpose  variants of the operating system 
- Linux Distribution 
	- Ubuntu: Gear towards general-purpose users
	- Kali lunix: designed specifically for security professionals 
		- BOTH specialized distribution of **Debian**

**Headless servers:** Cmd-line only machine

### [](#questions)Questions

1. Which distribution is most flexible and best suited for day-to-day and administrative tasks?
    - Ubuntu 
2. Which distribution is built specifically for penetration testers?
    - Kali Linux 
3. Which distributions would you use to set up a web or data server?
    - Debian, Ubuntu server, RHEL, AlmaLinux, and Fedora
4. What is the most widely used Linux desktop environment?
	- Ubuntu 

**Central Data Server**: stores all human resources data, including payroll information. Since its sole purpose is to send data to other machines, it doesn't have a monitor attached or need a GUI.

**Public Web Server**: handles a large number of requests every day. It also doesn't need a GUI. Since the web server is central to business operations, it needs to run quickly.

**IT Audit Workstation**: workstation is used for periodic assessments of network security.

**User Workstations** :need a GUI and should include basic productivity software (such as LibreOffice and email clients).

1. What is a "headless server"? Does Ubuntu make a headless server variant? What about Fedora? CentOS?
    - headless server is only Cmd line and does Ubuntu does have a headless ever variant
    - Fedora is an operating system 
    - CentOS - Stable predictable, magageable and reproducible platform derviced from the source of Red Hat Enterprise 
1. What distribution is Ubuntu based on? What about Kali?
    Debian 
3. Which distribution is CentOS based on? What about Fedora?
    Red Hat Enterpricese
    Linux OS kernel Architecture
1. What is SELinux? Which distributions implement SELinux by default?
    Security-Enhanced Linux - Provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies 
5. If you were deciding between versions of Ubuntu Server and wanted one that remains stable over time, which version would you choose?
    Ubuntu server because having flexibility have more customization 
6. What are some security implications of using free and open-source software or forks of popular Linux distributions?
![[4.1.2.jpg]]
parrotsec.og - good with pentesting 

tails limux distro (used to visit dark web and etc )

Which distribtion is built specifically for penetration tester? 
- Kali: Also based on Red Hat


**What is SELinux** 
![[4.1.3.jpg]]

![[4.1.4.jpg]]

![[4.1.5.jpg]]

check the Hash from the original people (checking if malware)
- get your source from official website


**Linux Files System Structure**
![[4.1.6.jpg]]![[4.1.7.jpg]]

![[4.1.8 1.jpg]]

ls /home -> See who is part of 
cd [press enter] -> go home to whom ever is signed in 

#Root 
Root, tha user
Root, the directory
Root, the user does not live in /home
Root lives in /root 
![[4.1.9.jpg]]
1. mkdir resarch 

2. cd /var/log 
	1. ls | grep auth.log 
	2. ![[4.1.10.jpg]]
3. cd [press enter]
	1. ls Desktop/
	2. ls Downloads/ 

![[4.1.11.jpg]]

4. Google Access the binary directory 
	1. /bin, /sbin, /lib 

![[4.1.12.jpg]]

5. 
![[4.1.14.jpg]]
- azadmin, http, jack, packer, should not be here

**Resources and Process**
![[4.1.15.jpg]]

**Memory:** Space used by a process to save and manipulate data 
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)** used to run the program's code
	- Only works when program is running 
**- Disk Space:** Save data permanently 

**Central Processing Unit (CPU)** : act as the brain of the system, determining how much work a process has to do and how difficult that work is 

![[4.1.16.jpg]]

![[4.1.17.jpg]]

![[4.1.18.jpg]]
- See how much storage, ram, etc will be running 
	- top: to see what is requiring a lot of your resources in REAL time(windows: task manager)
	- ps: snap chat of running processes 

**Dynamic analysis**: Process of running a potentially malicious script and monitoring its effects 
When do you use top vs ps 
- If you are looking up the PID or seeing what is being processed-> use PS
- Top if you need to see real time processing 
![[4.1.19.jpg]]
1. $top 
	2.Jack is using the most resource 
		1. PID - Process ID 
		2. PR - Priority 
		3. time + command - What cmd are they using 
1. $man ps, using either axu -> seeing every process 
		1.ps axu | less
man kill 
- if you are looking for a cmmd in manual type :
- /
kill  [process id]
shift + M -> Memory

2. fafa
	- ps aux |wc -l 
		- 926
		- Top 
			- says on top, sleeping 923, 3 running 
	- Shift +m
		- nessusd or gnome-shell is on top

3. top -u sysadmin 
	1. top -u root 

Jack is the highest stress
- top 
- sudo kill -u jack

sudo killall -u jack

NOTE -u = user 

top -u jack
