Decrypting 
___
**Key Management and Exchange**
**Symmetric key encryption**: use a single, shared key to encrypt and decrypt a message
![[10.2.1.jpg]]

**Disadvantage of Key Management and Exchange** 
1. **Secure Key Exchange** 
	1. More Individual are included in the key exchange, there needs to be a key for each combination of individuals
		1. **Offline Exchange (Out of band exchange)**
			1. Can include calling the recipient and reading the key, or mailing the key 
		2. Different-Hellman key exchange 
			1. Uses complex mathematical principles to create a share secret key between teo parties over a public channels
2. **Key Management**
	1. ![[10.2.2.jpg]]
	2. ![[10.2.3.jpg]]
3. These disadvantage can be addressed with asymmetric key encryption 

**Asymmetric Key Encryptions**
Private Key: Kept secret and can affect confidentiality of messages if exposed 
**Public key**: Public and accessible to all 

**Scenario**: Time wants to send Julie his bank account number using asymmetric key encryption

 - *** You have to know what it does but you dont need to use it (last slide)
____
**RSA**: Asymmetric algorithm standard used around the world 
- it works by employing the complexity of factoring large numbers 

____
**Applying Public key cryptography with GPG**
**GNU privacy Guard (GPG)**
GPG: 
- Cmd-line tool
	- Used to simplify the creation, encryption, and decryption of asymmetric key cryptography
- Free Program 
	- Available on many Linux distributions that ran symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms 

___
**Instructor Demonstration: GPG**
$gpg --gen-key
![[10.2.12.jpg]]
- Enter name and email address
- o -> Change name, email, O
	- use o
- Create password
	- 12345

![[10.2.13.jpg]]
- results after password
-   gpg: key D81710193A5FC56A marked as ultimately trusted
  gpg: directory '/home/instructor/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created
  gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/home/instructor/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/C4A3CFC51B1318FFD4D2C291D81710193A5FC56A.rev'
  public and secret key created and signed

![[10.2.14.jpg]]
- This is the list of keys

`gpg --armor --output julie.gpg --export julie@email.com`
	- This will be in Julie's terminal
	- This will allow access to julie.gpg (Public key)

![[10.2.15.jpg]]
- This creates a public key block 
- cat Julie.gpg


![[10.2.16.jpg]]
gpg --import julie.gpg
- This will allow the public key to be imported 
- This will be in Tim's termina; 
- It is to import julie.gpg 

![[10.2.17.jpg]]
- This will confirm that Julie's key has been imported 


$ 'echo "Hi Julie, my bank account number is 2783492" > Tims_plainmessage.txt'
- Creating a message (in tims terminal )

$gpg --armor --output Tims_encryptedmessage.txt --encrypt --recipient julie@email.com Tims_plainmessage.txt
- encrypting mesage
- - `gpg`: The command to run GPG.
- `--armor`: Puts the encrypted message in an ASCII format.
- `--output Tims_encryptedmessage.txt`: Command for the output file, which creates the name of the encrypted file.  
- `--encrypt`: Tells GPG to encrypt.
- `--recipient julie@email.com`: Tells GPG which public key to use, based on the email address of the key.
- `Tims_plainmessage.txt`: Specifies for GPG which plaintext file to encrypt.

$cat Tims_encryptedmessage.txt
- checking if file is encrypted 

**Going back to Tim**
`gpg --output Tims_decrypted_message --decrypt Tims_encryptedmessage.txt`
- `--output Tims_decrypted_message`: This creates an output file, which is the decrypted message.
- `--decrypt Tims_encryptedmessage.txt`: This is indicating to decrypt and what file to decrypt.

- - `cat Tims_decrypted_message`

___

**Hashing and Data Integrity**
Note: use Cryptography to protect privacy and confidentiality 
	It can also be applied to protect the integrity of data 
	
**Hashing**: Cryptographic method used to verify the integrity of data

![[10.2.21.jpg]]
- Hashing uses algorithms to input data and generate a unique output 
- Almost like encryption but it is different

**Difference between Encryption and Hashing**
1. Hashing does not have keys while Encrypting does
	- Encryption takes plaintext and converts it to ciphertext with a key and an algorithm 
1. Once hashing is converted, it can not be reverted 
	- Encrypting can be reverted by decrypting 
3. Hashing output fixed length regardless of input length 
	- ie: The length for "Hi" and "Hello my name is Sam and I like green eggs and ham" 
		- Both text will be the same length - about 32 text 
4. Different goals 
	- Encryption: Privacy
		- Allow others to see real information if they are authorized 
	- Hashing: Integrity 
		- Any small changes to the 1st text, even if one of the letters are change, it will change the entire hash
			- IE: the output hash for "Hello" will be different from "H3llo"," Hell0" , "He!!o", and so one
				- Each one will be different 

![[10.2.24.jpg]]


___
Instructor Demo: Creating Hashes on the CMD-line 
mkdir md5hash
cd md5hash
echo "This is my first hashing activity" > secretmessage
md5sum secretmessage 
- Note: This will create a hash 

___
![[10.2.25.jpg]]
![[10.2.31.jpg]]
Note: They give you a file to download 
1. cd /Alphabet_Bandit_Investigation_Reports/backup
2. md5sum * > hashes
	- If you hash all then cat, you will see a list 
	- ![[10.2.29.jpg]]
3.  mv hashes ../current/
	1. cd .. 
	2. cd current
	3. md5sum -c hashes
		1. ![[10.2.32.jpg]]
			- Result
4. Using diff
	-  `diff Investigation_1101 ../backup/Investigation_1101`
		- ![[10.2.33.jpg]]
			- 1101 file: 'Plutonium' was changed to 'gasoline'
	- `diff Investigation_1110 ../backup/Investigation_1110`
		- ![[10.2.34.jpg]]
		- 1110 file, 'word significant' was change to 'no'
____

**Digital Signatures**
**Digital signature:** Mathematical scheme used to verify the authenticity of digital data 
1. Key Creation: Create both public and private key 
	1. Public -> Allow accessible on website
	- Tim creates public and private key
2. Creating the Message: What is the request/ any notes
	- Tim wants to transfer 500$ to his account
3. Signing the message: Signs the message with private key to create digital signature 
	- Tim creates the message + his private key = Digital signature 
4. Sending The message: Sending digital signature with plaintext 
	- Tim Sends private key attach with message to Julie 
5. Validating the signature: To confirm if digital signature is legit, they use a validation tool
	- Julie use Tim's public key to validate the signature using a validation tool 

**Detached signature**: Message and signature are sent separately
