**Penetration Testing (Ethical hacking/ pen testing):** Offensive security practice of attacking a network using the same techniques that a malicious hacker would use, in an effort to identify security holes and raise awareness in an organization 

**Google Dorking** 
**Google Dorking:** reconnaissance tactic in which we manipulate Google searches to narrow down our queries in order to acquire actionable intel 

____
**Recap:**
**Reconnaissance:** Consists of gathering information about your target 
- **Passive Recon (Open source Intelligence (OSINT):** leverage information about the target that is publicly available on the internet 
	- Includes all domains and host belonging to a target that are publicly viewable 
	- OSINT: Gather information that is pbulicly 
		- This is legal
- **Active Room:** Refers to directly interacting with target's internal network 
	- this is illegal
	- Using programs to invade their information 

**Certificate Transparency:** Penetration tester gather information from certificate issuer which publish logs of the SSL/TLS certificate that they issue to organization 

**Shodan.io**: Reconnaissance website that conducts port scanning across the entire internet and catalogs the results for quick searching

**Gaining Initial Access**
MITRE defines initial access as;
- **Initial Access** consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initials foothold within a network 
- **Techniques** used to gain a foothold include targeted spear phisihing and exploiting weakness on public-facing web server 
- **Footholding**: gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords

two methods of gaining access on a target machine or network 
1. Phishing 
	- Most common method, in which the attacker crafts a fraudulent email that misleads the recipient into clicking on a link in the email
2. Remote services through valid accounts
	- This methods involves gaining access to the target by guessing credential on a VPN login portal
	- These techniques are categorized by MITRE as Valid accounts and external remote services 

shoulder surfing: Situation where the attacker can physically view device screen and keypads to obtain personal information 

**Phishing**
**Phishing:** most common way an attacker gains access to the internal network 
- goals:
	- Only to cotain credentials 
	- Contains malicious link that will install malware or backdoor on the victim's computer 
- Red vs blue team
	- Red team: This is most popular attack
	- Blue team learns how to expertly counter phishing 

*Telltale sign that an email is a phishing attempt?*
- Grammatic errors 
- Emojis 
- header is wrong 
- CEO/ unrelated emailing you for improper request
	- purchase gift card and send it within the next 30 minutes
	- 

**Tellate signs of phishing:
- **types**: 
- In the body of email and sender ‘s email address
- **Typosquatting** 
	- Common tactic which attacker will register fraudulent domain similar to the legitimate domain 
		- Ie: Google.com vs goog1e.com 
- **Subdomain**
	- Registered to mimic real domains 
	- Ie: payments.google.com vs paymentsgoogle.bogusdomain 
		- Domains can be spoofed if proper DNS protection 
		- After @ of an email is not the same 
- Phone calls from AI generated Voice
	- Call them back with known phone number 

Note: if an email asks you do something that’s not traditionally part of your job or possibly risky, it’s always better to confirm the task in person or by another means of contract

**Valid Accounts, External Remote services, and password guessing** 
Another way of gaining initial access is by finding a VPN configuration files belonging to the target and logging into the   stolen credentials
- **Valid Accounts** 
	- Attackers use real user account to gain access 
- ***remote services** 
	- Attackers use remote services such as a vpn to try and gain access from outside of target’s network 

**PASSWORD GUESSING**: the systematic method of guessing passwords to obtain access into a target 
- commonly used passwords; 12345
- Season and year: Winter2024
- Variant of “password”: pas$word User’s own usernames/ variant: bob or b0b

___
Activity: Access Remote services through Valid Account 
VPN.sh 
- Downloaded to we can try to brute force into the the database of megacorpone
![[cat.Vpn 1 1.jpg]]
cat vpn.sh 

![[CHMODRunVPn.jpg]]
Made vpn.sh into an executable by CHMOD +x 
run; ./vpn.sh
this allows us to go into the vpn and scan network locally
___
**Scanning and internal Reconnaissance** 
**Conduct** 
- **passive reconnaissance**: to find domain and users from our target

**Gained**
- **initial access**: use of remote service through Valid account**

**Internal Reconnaissance**
**Active reconnaissance (Internal Reconnaissance):** Directly interacting with our target 
- Perform reconnaissance inside the internal network 
	- To reveal which device are on the network and what potential new targets awaits 
- Inside the network we can gather;
	- **Host Enumeration:** Infroamtion about the host 
	- **Process Enumeration:** Information about processes on the system
	- Information about the user on the system

![[16.2.0.jpg]]
**Scanning**: Second phase of pen testing scanning uses tools to gather information such as network information and potential vulnerabilities 
- Scan our target from inside their network
- Scanning can conduct eternally and before initial access 

Tools for scanning 
- Nessus (Vulnerability scanner)
	- We are using this tool 
- Hping 
- nmap.org 
	- We will use this tool more 

**NMap (scanning tool)**
Nmap
- Scanning tool that covered in network section
- Use to identify which ports are open, their services and their version
- Search network for any potentially vulnerable services that are outdated or potentially be abused 
	- IE: Brute forcing SSH logins 

![[16.2.1.jpg]]


___
**Instructor Demo: Nmap and Zenmap **

![[ZenmapScan 1.jpg]]
in zenmap we are going to use nmap 
- nmap 
	- It is to scan the vulnerability
- A 
	- Aggressive 

Target 172.22.117.0/24 and hit scan
- Note this is our Kali ip address (172.22.117.100)
	- We want to check other internal networks 
	- We are checking our own Ip because we are in the VPN system 
	- if you turn anything with a 0 at the end, it will scan all network 
	- his is scanning all target 
	- It is look for an vulnerability 
- Note we have 172.22.117.150 after the scan
	- This shows that there are available ports 

NOTE: This shows that the state is vulnerable (exploitable)
- Ig there are any ports
- We should check the version 
	- IE: put this in google: vsFTPd verison 2.3.4 exploit
		- This might have a file called .py

**Vulnerability Scanning** 

**NSE Scripts Vs Vulnerability Scanning**
- NSE is not fully comprehensive, meaning many vulnerabilities are not covered.
- NSE cannot perform a large number of scans simultaneously
- NSE is most efficient when performing single host scans
- NSE is most useful when doing basic information gathering or enumeration tasks

Note: 
- Vulnerability scanner will attempt to log into system using default passwords or other credentials in order to establish a more detailed picture of the network infrastructure 
	- Establishing an inventory list vulnerability scanner check each item against one or more databased of known vulnerabilities
		- This identifies which items are associated with specific threats 

**Pen Testing Vs Vulnerability Scanning**
**Vulnerabiltiy Scanning**
- Identifies system that have known vulnerability;
	- Scans use a database of known vulnerability 
	- Vulnerabilities are rated based on the severity level
	- Vulnerabilities are given a common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) score

**Penetration Testing**
- Attempts to identify weakness that can be exploited; 
	- Specific system configurations 
	- Organizational processes and practice

**Vulnerability scanning and Nessus**
Vulnerability scanner (Like Nessus) that identifies vulnerabilities and creates inventory of all interconnected systems;
- Servers 
- Containers 
- Desktops 
- Firewall
- Laptops
- Switches 
- Virtual Machines 
- Printers 

___
Instructor Demo: Nessus

___
**SearchSploit**
Note:
- Through Nmap scans, we found several services on several machines on the network
- These services and their version can quickly be searched for any vulnerabilities and exploits written for them 

**SearchSploit** Uses to locally store a library of exploit information and scripts needed to execute the exploits 

**Exploit Database (Exploit-DB)** : A popular online databsed that contains publicly disclosed exploits 
- Accord to their **common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)**

SearchSploit is a command-line utility for Exploit-DB that allows you to take an offline copy of the Exploit Database with you wherever you go

___
Instructor Demo: SearchSploit

searchsploit ftpd | grep 2.3.4
- This cmd will search for any exploit of that was ftpd 2.3.4
![[vsftpd2.3.4 exploit 1.jpg]]
- This is the site that you look up
- vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit on google 

![[CmdRemotemachine 1.jpg]]
Download the .py file from above 
- and ran python3 .py file (twice)

I was able to sign intoe the account 
- I can run command hostname
	- It gave me the host name: metasploitable 
- NOTE: this is Shell Access / remote shell 
___
![[16.2.3.jpg]]

____
**Exploitation with Shell**
![[16.2.4.jpg]]

Two types of Shell;
1. **Bind Shell**
	- Remote host opens a port for the current host to connect to 
	- Current, local host then connects to that remote host's port
	- ![[16.2.6.jpg]]
1. **Reverse Shell**
	- Remote host connects back to a port to the local host
	- ![[16.2.5.jpg]]

NOTE: 
- run a phishing email that has a script that allows you to connect to the hacker's computer 
	- This is a reverse shell
	- This one is more common because it is easier for you to connect to the computer 
		- This makes the computer into a zombie 
- Opening a back door
	- Bind shell 
		- It is up to you to connect 

**Netcat (Swiss army knife)**: Use to bind and reverse shell
- network tool 
- Assist with many security and admin activities 

___
Instructor Demo: Shells
we are in the metasploit machine that we were able to access (in megacorpone)

![[Power shell 2.jpg]]
In google- Reverse Shell Generator 
- Not we want to enter the computer whenever

1. We want to know our attacker ip address
	1. $ip a 
2. Reverse shell generator  
	1. ip (your ip)
	2. port (port number)
		1. pick what you want to connect too 
		2. You want binbash 
3. In the command line 
	1. nc -lvnp 9001
		1. You want a net cat to listen with this ip 
4. You will copy the reverse shell generator script 
5. Go to the Metasploit cmd and run script 
	- If it does not work, run different commonads from the site 
	2. JThis will create a script
