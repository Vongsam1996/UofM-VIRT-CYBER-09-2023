**Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is cybersecurity such a desired skill these days?
- The pay 
- More opportunity jobs

Reason 4: Significant Investment by Bad Actors 
- Field was once populated by individual “lone attackers” 
  

Reason 5:
-  70 % of cybersecurity professionals says that their organization has been impacted by the ongoing global cybersecurity skills shortage  
  

Cyber security: assessing threats and mitigating risk 

- Hacking and trying to prevent 
- Trying to find solution against possible exposure 
- Mitigate but not eliminate - have to pull the plug or remove all together 

Mitigating Risk 
- Breachers are assumed and risk associate with such events also needs to be mitigated 
- Anyone can be compromised   
- KeyLogger: Extract information by examining the victim's inputs (key - password inputs) 


Virtual Machines: Operate various operating systems and tools throughout the curriculum
- Web Lab VMS 
- Azure Cloud Lab services
- Personal Azure Cloud accounts

Access Threats: 
Example: You find a wild USB on the ground and you decide to plug it. 
1. How is a USB drive able to do this? 
	1. Malware software is installed
	2. Can invade your information 
	3. Can destroy their computer 
2. Why can’t our computer stop the drive from running?
	1. We do not have the encryption for the USB 
	2. No safe environment to trap the virus 
	3. Lack of correct software to protect themselves 
	4. Sandbox
5. How might we defend against USBs like this? 
	1. Educating employees 
	2. Correct software to protect 
	3. DO not plug in the USB
	4. Not auto running the USB
	5. Scan the USB
	6. Use someone’s computers
	7. Bitlocker - Encrypt all your information 
	8. Disable USB drive/ auto run 


Flipper and raspberry pico - they are computers with a operating system. 
- Can use it to deliver malware and other programs
-
Harmless USB - can have a mini-keyboard

***CIA Triad: 3 cornerstones of information security ***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Confidentiality (Non-public information)
	1. Example: Hacked customer’s information would make the company look unreliable
	2. State of being kept secret or private 
2 . Integrity (untempted information)  
	4. Protecting information from being modified or tampered by unauthorized person  
	5. Having strong morals 
		1. Hacking their information and turning it usable (encrypted their files)  
		2. Steal employer’s assets 
		3. The quality of being honest, whole or undivided
		4. Venmo sending money - Sending 100 and received 100
	
1. Availability (access to data) 
	1. Ensuring that all operating system, equipment, and data are functioning correctly and accessible by those who need it 
	2. The easy access to companies would still be welcome even if they were hacked - Amazon, twitter, etc. 
	3. If companies that are not working properly then customers can not go there and slowly stop 
	4. Quality of being able to be used or obtained**
