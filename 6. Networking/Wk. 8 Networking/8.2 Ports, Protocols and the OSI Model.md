Ports Real World Analogy
- Office building is the IP address
- Video conference room is the port 

Ports and Security
- Ports are the access points for transmitting and receiving data 

**Inter assigned number Authority IANA**: The entity officially responsible for assigning port numbers for a designated purpose 

Virtual Ports
- Corresponding port is the destination port 
	- where other machine send data to communicate with that protocol 
		- ex: Machine sending an HTTP message to a web server sends traffic to server's port 80
- Computers without enough physicals space for every protocol 

**Port Number**
1. system port
	1. Range number: 0 - 1023
	2. Know as: Well-known ports
	3. Explanation: Restricted: Only OS or administrator can bind services to these ports. HTTP runs on 80 so any port 80 can not access this ports. 
2. registered port
	1. Range number: 1024 - 49151
	2. Known as: User ports
	3. Explanation: Normal users launching their own services will do so using ports in this range 
3. dynamic private ports 
	1. Range number: 49152 - 65595
	2. Known as: Dynamic ports/ private ports 
	3. Explanation: When a machine sends data to another machine (must be open a port to send from: Source port) and it randomly chosen from the dynamic range whenever a machine sends a message

**OSI Layer** 
![[8.2.46.jpg]]

**Open System Interconnection**: Model is a framework that conceptualizes the steps data takes during tranmission, making it easier to communciate where thr issues exist
![[8.2.24.jpg]]
**Open System Interconnection (OSI)**: Model is a framework that conceptualizes the steps data takes during transmission, making it easier to communication where Issue exit 
- (Please do not throw sausage, pizza away )
- Physical (Payer 1): Responsible for transmission of binary data through a physical medium 
	- Handles how data is physically encoded and decoded
	- Switches
- Data Link (Layer 2): Establishes links between nodes
	- Ensure data gets to its final destination without corruption thus protecting data integrity
	- Routing/ IP address 
- Network (Layer 3): Routes data through physical networks using an IP address, deciding which physical path the data will take, and ensuring it gets to the correct destination 
- Transport (Layer 4): Actually transmitting data across the network 
	- IT puts data onto the network and assign sources and destination ports 
- Session (Layer5): Manage connection between ports on computers and handles data flow 
- Presentation (Layer 6): Translator for the network
	- Formats data to be presented to the application layer, handles data representation, decryption and encryption, character set translation and conversion 
		- Conversion to prepare to a customer through email and etc.
- Application (Layer 7)
	- Representing data in a way the consuming application can understand 
		- This is the layer a user interacts with such as a web or email application 


___
Encapsulation and Decapsulation 
![[8.2.47.jpg]]
Layer 7: Infromation that is collected 
Layer 6: Decoding
Layer 5:
Layer 4: Transfer to network
Layer 2: 
Layer 1: Exiting through the house to other servers



![[8.2.25.jpg]]
Layer 1: Data hits Phyiscal first
- Cables 
Layer 2: If the MAC Address matches -> We will know who sent it 
- Valid MAC Address
layer 3: Look at the MAC Address and determine if it is correct information to to collected 
- Add IP Addresses 
Layer 4: Are toy trying to talk to me to the right port 
- Ports
Layer 5: Create a session to see if we need to collect more information
- TCP 
Layer 6: Extract that information and decode it 
- encrypt/ decrypt
Layer 7: It is the information that we are interacting with 


TCP/IP**** **IMPORTANT - REMEBER THE STEPS**
![[8.2.26.jpg]]
- What each layer does and their importance as an example 
- They want you know it starts from a physically level -> Goes through layers then goes through application

**Questions they may ask about OSI** 
What are the Layers of OSI? 
Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away

**What is TCP**
Model to explain how IP works

What is a mac address and how is it different from IP Address
MAC Address : Used to ensure the physical address of the computer 
IP Address are used to uniquely identifies the connection of the network with that device takes part in a network


What is the significance of DNS? 
Domain Name system 

Define NAT?

EHow are OSI and TCP/IP Model different 


Can you define data encapsulation? 
Converting through the OSI model?
___
![[8.2.27.jpg]]
1. A networking cable was cut in the data center, and now no traffic can go out.
	- Layer 1: Physical Layer
2. A code injection was submitted from an administrative website, and it's possible that an attacker can now see unauthorized directories from your Linux server.
	- Layer 7: Application
3. The MAC address of one of your network interface cards was spoofed and is preventing some traffic from reaching its destination.
	- Layer 2: Data Link Layer 
4. Your encrypted web traffic is using a weak encryption cipher, and the web traffic is now vulnerable to decryption.
	- Layer 6: Presentation 
5. The destination IP address was modified, and traffic is being routed to an unauthorized location.
	- Layer 3: Network
6. A flood of TCP requests is causing performance issues.
	- Layer 4: Transportation 
7. A SQL injection attack was detected by the SOC. This SQL injection may have deleted several database tables.
	- Layer 7: Application Layer
8. A switch suddenly stopped working, and local machines aren't receiving any traffic.
	- Layer 2 Data Link
9. An ethernet cable was disconnected, and the machine connected isn't able to receive any external traffic.
	- Layer 1: Physical
10. Traffic within the network is being directed from the switch to a suspicious device.
	- Layer 2: Data Link

Wireshark collects and analyze the kinds of websites and webpages individuals on the network are viewing, as well as the type of communication occurring

**Analysis HTTP**

![[8.2.43 1.jpg]]
Use Wireshark to view HTTP traffic: 
1. Open Michael's web traffic file, michael.pcapng, in Wireshark
	1. Form file> open > navigate to the packet capture michael.pcapng 
2. Add an HTTP filter to view only HTTP traffic 
	1. Select HTTP and press enter 


![[8.2.44.jpg]]
All HTTP traffic is displayed but we want to foucs on the website that were visited
- View only website that were accessed
	- http.request.method == "Get" 
		- http.request.method: TElls the filter to look for the method that HTTP is requesting
		- == "Get": only return the [get] method; get HTML data from the web server so your browser can display it 
		- post: sumbit or post infomration to web server 

![[8.2.45.jpg]]
Using http.request.method == "POST"
- Return all request made to web server to submit or post information such as submitting form day a

The [POST] request is returned. Open the Packet Detail pane to further analyze the data submitted to the web server 
- Expand the [urlencoded-form] field to view the data, and read the form communication that was sent

Clearly shows that Michael sent a message to the car shop stating that he plans to call in sick to go car shopping
