**Ansible Playbooks**
Ansible container has full access to our VNet and can connect with our new VM
- Write code that will be "Infrastructure as code" for this vulnerable web server 
- Reads YAML
	- YAML
	- Aint
	- Markup
	- Language 

Note: Ansible is a provisioner 
- It will help us build and set up a computers 
- Instruct how you want your computers to be set up
![[13.3.1 1 1.jpg]]
YAML 
- It is used to design to be readable and simple use

Instructor Demo: YAML Guided Tour 

Sign into your Jump-box 
- note: 4.196.157.179 (Jump-box ip address)
- Github
	- ssh azadmin@4.196.157.179

Looking at different container
- $sudo docker ps -a
- Results:![[13.3.2 1 1.jpg]]
	- Note: Container name: Friendly_agent


Start and accesssing Container/ ping if it worked
$sudo docker start friendly_agnesi
$sudo docker attach friendly_agnesi
$ansible all -m ping
![[13.3.3 1 1.jpg]]
- NOTE: if it does not work for ping
	- $ls -la 
		- To show if you have ansible
			- $nano /etc/ansible/hosts
				- Find #[webserver]
				- Remove comment
				- Add the ip on the bottom of webserver
					- 10.0.0.6 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
					- 10.0.0.5 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
				- NOTE: 10.0.0.6 and 10.0.0.5 are Ip addresses for VMs web 1 and 2 
					- VMs webs were created in 13.1 - Introduction to cloud computing
			- nano /etc/ansible/ansbile.cfg
				- find #remote_user = root 
				- Remove the comment and root 
				- Add sysadmin (This is the user that was inputed into your jumpbox/ web 1 and web 2)
					- It should look like 
						- remote_user = sysadmin

Setting up YAML playbook 
nano /etc/ansible/pentest.yml

`name: Config Web VM with Docker

        `restart_policy: always
        `published_ports: 80:80
	        - We are using port 80 
- Note: This is making sure that web 1 and web 2 are both running in port 80 and is running the same 

`name: Enable docker service
      `systemd:
        `name: docker
        `enabled: yes
- Note: Making sure that docker is running everytime 
- When ever a server is restarting, docker is also resetting 

NOTE: You can ask ansible to run any command
- Can add users and other cmd

To check the command 
- You can uuse 
- YAMLlint.com 

Running playbook 
`ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/pentest.yml`
-Results 
![[13.3.5.1 1.jpg]]
- if 10.0.6 or 10.0.5 failed 
	- You have to make sure your nano /Hosts has 10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6 both have webserver and the right command 
- Note this will allow playbook to be running in both servers 

Double check: Rerun command 
$ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/pentest.yml

We want to check if web 1 is working 
$ssh sysdmin@10.0.0.5

curl localhost/setup.php
- Test connection 
- If everything is working you should get back HTML from the DVWA containers 
- What to find/results

___
**Load Balancing**
We have; 
- Created a Vnet 
- Deployed a jump box running an Ansible Docker Container
- Used that container to configure another VM running a DVWA container
Note: Red team attacks this DVMA container with enough traffic 
- Triggers a "Denial of Service (DoS)

![[13.3.7 1.jpg]]
- This can adjust the amount of power towards different server 
	- Can tell the Load balancer if there is too much, then run another sserver 
		- If it is lower then remove or pause the server 
- Server does not need Private and public servers for server 1 and 2 because it is the same as 3 
![[13.3.8 1.jpg]]
- Health check 
	- If there is no traffic then it will stop the server 
	- If the machine is not working then it will stop sending traffic to that server 

**Load Balancer** 
![[13.3.2 1.jpg]]
- Load balancer provides the external ip address that the rest of the internet can access ->
- Receives traffic that comes into the website and distributes it across multiple server 

![[13.3.3 1.jpg]]
- Load balancer offers **Health probe** function;
	- Regularly check all machines behind the load balancer
- Machines issues are reported and load balancer stop sending traffic to those machines 

Note: DVMA VM we set up is not accessible from the internet at this time (Intentional)
- Sett pup a load balancer that has an external IP and point it to the VM 

____
Instructor Demo Setting up a load balancer 

___
![[13.3.9 1.jpg]]
Setting up load balancer on Azure 
- Load balancer
- Basic
	- Name: Red-Team-LB 
	- SKU: Basic
	- Type: Public
- Frontend IP Configuration (asking for Ip)
	- Name: Red-Team-LB
	Public Ip address
	- Created new 
		- name: Red-Team-LB
		- Assignment: Static 
	- Add
- Backend pools (Track web 1 and 2 )
	- Add a back end pool
		- name: Red-Team-Backend-Pool
		- Virtual network: ReadTeamNet(red-team)
	- Add **** Need a fix 
		- Web-1
		- Web-2
Note: If you are checking web-1 and web-2 does not shwo 
- They are both in different resource 
Note: If you add web 3 -> you can go back and add them backk
- Loadbalancer -> Red-team -> Backend pool -> Web 3 

- Review and create 
- Create 
Note: Load balancer does cost money 

**Add Health probe**(Tracking)
Name: RedTeamProbe
Note: If not made -> If the server is down -> Traffic can still be sent to it 

____
**Firewall Configuration**


Note: next activity we will be able to reach the DVMA website from the internet 
![[13.3.5.jpg]]
- Configure a security group to allow web traffic into the VNet from the laod Balancer 

____
Instructor Demo: Load Balancing Rule
___
![[13.3.6.jpg]]
NOTE: The loadbalancer is blocking firewall -> We need to allow traffic to the load balancers 

Go back to load Balancers 
- load balancing rules 
Name: PentestBR
Frontend Ip address: Red-Team-LB
Backend IP : Red-team-Backend-Pool
Port: 80
Backend port: 80
Session persistence: Client IP and protocol 
- This is important because it needs to keep checking the ip of the client 
	- Does not make new cookies 
Timeout: 4 minutes

Firewall - Need to allow load balancer into network 
network security -> RedTeam-SG-> Inbound security rules -> Add
source: My IP address
- DO NOT WANT any 
	- Do not want to show your IP address to anyone 
service: HTTP
Priority: 102
- Between 100 and 4096
- above the default deny 
	- need to delete it at some point


____
**How to access website** 
what is our ip address to our load balancer 
- Load balancers 
	- In Frontend IP configuration 
		-   20.5.94.6

http://20.5.94.6/setup.php 
![[13.3.10.jpg]]

Instruction was able to work 
About was able to work 


Trouble shoot 
check if load balancer is working 
check if firewall configuration is correct 
check if the url works
