**GRC Framework questions**:
1. What Assets are most Important? 
2. What is adequate protection?

**GRC Framework**
1. **Governance**: Creating management processes for implementing security practice across the organization 
	1. How to protect company's data
	
2. **Risk Management**: Identifying an organization's most important assets and determining how they might be compromised 
	1. How to prevent breaches with sensitive data 

3. Compliance: Making sure the business follows internal security policies and adheres to relevant security laws
	1. Policies and other laws to protect the companies 

What is Important? 
- How would a security compromise of this asset affect the profits of the business?

**GRC Framework** 
------------------------
Executive team: Ultimately responsible for the adherence and enforcement of laws, regulations, and security practice 

**Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**: Responsbiel for plotting the overall direction of company
- CEO reports to **Board of Director** 
	- Elected by shareholders and holds the CEO accountable 

Under the CEO; 
**Chief Financial Officer (CFO)** Charts and monitors the company's financial trajectory
- Ensure the company uses its finances wisely 

**Chief operating officer (COO)**: Ensures a business is able to function effectively day-to-day 
- Typically reports directly to the CEO

**Chief Information security officer (CISO)**: Manages risk to an organization's data throughout its lifecycle

**Chief information officer (CIO)**: Develops IT systems that support the business 
- Reports to CEO typically

Security team must interact with different departments; marketing, communications, IT, and networking

**Security Team's main goal:** Protect the business's data
**Business's main goal:** Maximize profit and improve efficiency 

**What should the Security Team Do?**
- **Security team**: Would probably advise against the new feature due to its poor security 
- **business-at-large**: Might decide to develop it anyways believing the potential profit is worth the risk 

The security team must adapt its operation to accommodate a product they know is insecure 
- NOTE: No matter the decisions of the business, you MUST follow along and figure out all the dangers 
- Put in place more aggressive monitoring on data servers likely to be exposed by the new feature 
- Advise IT and networking to put in place more sophisticated access controls on important servers and proxies

**Security Culture**
---
![[ddddd.jpg]]

**Security Culture**: Is the way members of an organization think abut the apporach security issues. 
- Security culture has employees who are invested in the organization's security aand "behave securely"

**Framework Scenario**: 
Employees are receiving emails to their work accounts from external source
1. Employees are clicking on links and downloading attachments in these emails 
2. The organization's security team determined that many of the links and attachments contain malware 

Step 1: Measure and set goals 
- **Security culture framework steps:
1. Measure and set goals 
	1. How many people are clicking email phishing and set goals 
2. Involve the right people
	1. Management, IT, Etc 
	2. They pay for training and people take time out of their productivity    
		1. Have management get your back     
		2. If not communicated then strike 
3. Create an action plan 
	1. Creating a training plan 
	2. Set goals  
4. Execute the plan 
	5. Experiment after 
5. Measure change 
	1. measure how many people click on email phishing**

**Security culture framework:** identifies problems in an organization's security culture and develops plans to solve them

**EX security culture framework steps:

**1. Measure and set goals**
	1. Hire a pen testing firm to begin a phishing campaign that will send out phishing emails to users in the company. 
		1. Firm will keep track of how many user fal for pushing email
**2. Involve the right people**
	1. Training will affect all member of organization, inform executive team about the problem and your decision to implement training 
		1. CEO, CIO, HR
**3. Create action plan**
	1. After getting clearance to run the training plan, to deliver an annual cybersecurity awareness training event 
		1. Develop training to cover dangers of malware and how malware can spread
**7. Execute the plan**
	1. After developing the training, implement it wit the goal of training 25% of employees every quarter 
**9. Measure changes** 
	1. After training the entire company, have the pentesters reimplement the original; phishing campaign 
		1. Determine success or failure based on goals set in step 1

**Activity 1: Security Culture framework - part 1 
--
"Employees have been observed holding the door open for others behind them when accessing the building, without each employee scanning their own individual badge.  

The organization has determined that this behavior has led to several non-employees gaining unauthorized and undocumented access to several offices. With over 500 current employees, you can imagine how this might introduce serious issues.

Crucially, the Incident Response team recently identified that an attacker was able to steal confidential financial data from the servers in the Finance department. These machines are not connected to the internet, so the breach must have resulted from physical access to the Finance machines."

Problem: Employees have been observed hold ing the door open for others behind them when accessing the build 

How: 
- Measure how many people come in without badges (tailgating)
- Motion sensors cameras (face ids)
- Signed in employees (badged/ scheduled)
- Key access pad ( see unique people entered legally)
- mantraps     
- Turn style    
- Visitors logs    
- Security guard    
- Retina scans? Chip implants? 
- Training 

Risk 
- Unauthorized attackers that can access your computer/servers 
- Theft 
- Physical damages
- Employee personal belonging
- Physical safety

Goal: 
- 5 - 10%
Timeline 
- 90 days**

**What a company do 
Step 1: 
Security culture (SCF) team meet to assess the impact of the phishing incident and the risk posed by future campaign 
- Discussion;
- Assessment of the damage done by the previous phishing incident 
- Using pentesting phishing attacks to show many many employees download malicious files 
-  Setting target    

Step 2 
SCF team manager meets with CISO to explain previous phishing attack because ____

Step 3
Develop team develop training plan 
- Awareness training plan
- Delivered to employees who continue to click malicious links after training 

Step 4
SCP team decides on incentives and disincentive 
- Incentives: 40$ gift card, free or discounted security conference attendance, and additional vacation time 
- Disincentive: Supplemental security awareness training and additional random device audits for one quarter

Step 5
SCF team collaborates with HR to determine the best dates to run training 
- HR team explains that the most reliable way to ensure 100% attendance over the next fiscal year is to have quarterly training session training 25% of employees each time
- SCF and HR coordinator the specific dates and location of the training 

Step 6
SCF team collaborates with communication to develop and distribute information about the training 

Step 7
SCF Team sets up and implements the training as scheduled**

**Step 8
SCF team contracts the same pentesting firm to run the phishing campaign against all employees who have already been trained 
- Test is expensive

Step 9
Every test, the SCF team identifies employees who still clicked malicious links, and requires them to go through supplemental security awareness training 

Step 10 
SCF team ruins a final phishing campaign to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the training**


Activity 2: Security Culture framework - part 2 
1.Make an Action Plan: Identify your "plan of attack." For example, you might propose to implement training, implement stricter security controls, or some combination of the two.
- Training, communicating with everyone

2.Schedule: Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: Explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.
- 90 days - 1 year to train everyone 
- Q1 25%   

3.Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs): Explain what you will measure to determine if your plan has been successful. Specify KPIs indicating what you want your plan to achieve. These are your planned goals.
- 0 - 5%  

4.Measurements: Explain how you will measure the success of your plan. Specify both when and how you'll measure results.
- Recreating recurring training like target

**What's the (action) plan**:
1. When will the plans be executed? 
	1. SCF and HR teams will implement the training once
		1. Training 25% of employees each time 
	2. Ensure 100% of employees will be trained by the end of the year
2. When will you measure progress? 
		1.  SCF Team will implement a phishing campaign each quarter, targeting only the most recently trained cohort
			1. After all cohorts have been trained, A final campaign will test how well everyone follows the new guidelines over time 
3. How will you quantify progress? 
		1. SCF Team decides to quantify the click-through rate, which is the percentage of employees who download malicious links from emails 
			1. Goals is to decrease he number from 10% to 5%

**Security Control**
--
**Security Control**: Is any system, process, or technology that protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a resource 

![[Security control.jpg]]

**Preventative control**: Prevent access with physicals or technical barriers
**Deterrent control**: Discourage attackers from attempting to access a resource
- warning shots/ ADT sign
**Detective control**: Identify and alert attempts to access a resource 
**Corrective control:** Attempt to fix an incident, and possibly stop it from happening again
- fixing the problem and creating preventative controls  
**compensating control**: Restore the function of compromised systems 
- What is needed to fix lost data, compromised data and systems, and how long it will take 

![[exmplas of programs.jpg]]

**Defense in depth**: Practice of using multiple defenses to secure a resource 
- Multiple security  **-  (physical, technical, and administrative controls)** 

***Control Diversity***: Multiple layers of protection because it is protected in multiple ways
- Protect the SSH Server with firewall
- If bypass, user needs to use authentication with SSH key 
- If both are valid, Limited time since stolen key will expire after most three months 

**Redundancy**: Defending the system with multiple methods ensures that it remains protected even if one of them fails
- **Single Point of Failure**: System with only a single control
	- Attackers can compromise the system by breaking single controls 
	- Only 1 type/ layer of defense

**Activity part 3: Security Control**
Mantraps - Physical control 
- Restrict access 
employees/ customers  - Send out policy and allow them a trainer and knowledge what they are requesting before they can access the building 
- Punishment: 1 time warning, 2nd time restrict access and training, 3rd time write up, and after 3 times then terminated
Jail fencing - Restricting from different countries/ location

**Governance**: Portion of the GRC framework used to enforce security standards, policie, and procedures
