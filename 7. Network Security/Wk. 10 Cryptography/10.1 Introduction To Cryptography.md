![[10.1.0.jpg]]

**Cryptography:** A Primary method for keeping information secure

NOTE - Scenario;
We will be playing a role of security analysts at the hill valley police Department
- Investigating Alphabet bandits who is responsible for a number of burglaries in Hill Valley 
- The Alphabet Bandit likes to leave hidden messages after each burglary, and we must use cryptographic techniques to investigate the incidents

**History Of Cryptography**
**Cipher**: Method of designing secret or hidden message

Caesar Cipher
- Roman developed a cipher to hide his communication 
- Ex: 
![[10.1.1.jpg]]
- Goal: Prevent unauthorized parties from reading the communication but allow authorized parties to receive and understand hidden message

**introduction to Character Encoding** 
![[10.1.6.jpg]]

![[10.1.7.jpg]]

ACII Encoding
American Standard code for information interchange (ASCII): Representation of every upper and lowercase letter of English alphabet
- Common punctuation marks and graphic and mathematical symbols 
- 0 - 255

**Decimal system:** a little more limited 
- Consists of the characters 
	- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0

![[10.1.8.jpg]]
- This conversion is called **Hex to ASCII encoding** or **Hex-to-text encoding**
- Binary data can be more efficiently stored and represented by encoding with the hexadecimal number system 

**Octal System**: Applies a principle similar to hex but uses digits 0 - 7

**Goals of Cryptography**
![[10.1.10.jpg]]
**Privacy**: Keeps data secure from unauthorized parties
- **Data in motion:** Data moving between devices
	- IE: Bob send an encrypted email to Alice, saying "The meeting is at noon"
		- Protect confidentiality of the data in motion 
			- the email data moving across internet between bob and Alice would need to be encrypted 
- **Data at rest:** Static data (stored on hard drive/ database)
	- IE: Data stored on your laptop
		- To protect the data, hard drive would be encrypted 

**Authentication:** used to confirm the identities of the sender and receiver of data 
- Even though message is encrypted, attackers can still send encrypted data 
	- IE: 
		- Bob sends to Alice "Meeting is at noon"
		- Hacker Tim impersonating bob sends Alice "The meeting is cancelled "
		- Alice received the email

**Integrity:** Ensures a message is not altered between when its sent and when its received 
- Messages is encrypted and sender is authenticated
	- Attacker can still alter contents of message
	- IE:
		- Bob sends to Alice "Meeting is at noon"
		- Tim (disruptive hacker) Intercepts email and impersonating bob " Meeting is at 5am"
		- Alice received intercepted email

**Non-repudiation:** prevents the original sender from denying they were sender
- Sender claiming they did not send inappropriate message to coworkers 
	- when they did

___
**Introduction to Cryptography Ciphers**
**Algorithms:** Mathematical instructions that ciphers use for encryption 
- **Stream ciphers** apply their algorithm one bit (Character) at a time

![[10.1.11.jpg]]
- **Substitution cipher**: Substitutes out old values for new values of input message 
	- IE: Caesar and Enigma cipher examples 
		- Substitution alone does not provide strong encryption when combined with other techniques it can provide strong, fast encryption 

**Block Cipher**: apply their algorithm to chunk of characters 
- **Transposition Cipher:** breaks an input message into equal sized blocks and rearranges the letters of each block
![[10.1.12.jpg]]
1. Break message into blocks of three characters
2. Replace the first, second, and third characters of each block with the third, first, and second characters
3. Combine rearranged text

___
**Modern Cryptography**
**Key Space**: Each algorithm has a possible range of numbers that can be used as a key
- IE: Password with only numerical digits with possible value 
	- 0, 1, 2, 3, ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9
		- key space is 10

**Bit size:** Modern cryptography key space is defined by the number of binary bits used in the key

**How much more secure is x more bits of encryption**

![[10.1.15.jpg]]
![[10.1.26.jpg]]


____
**Symmetric Key Algorithms**
If Larger bit size means stronger encryption, why don't we just use a million-bit key?
- Takes time and computational resource to encrypt and decrypt larger key
- Is the encryption strength worth time to use the key?

![[10.1.16.jpg]]

**Modern Symmetric Key Algorithms:** Algorithms that are secure and fast
- Symmetric key algorithms use a single, shared key to encrypt and decrypt a message
- Shared key needs to remain private 
- EI of symmetric key algorithms;
	- Data Encryption standard (DES)
	- Triple DES (3Des)
	- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
NOTE: These three are going to be on your test!
- DES - 3DES - AES
