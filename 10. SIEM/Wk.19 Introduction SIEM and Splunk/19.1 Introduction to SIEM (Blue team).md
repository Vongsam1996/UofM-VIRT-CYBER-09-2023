**Introduction to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
- SIEM: Security Information and Even Management 
	- Tool 
	- Should know what this is because this is what Blue team does

**Introduction to Continuous Monitoring**
**Continuous Monitoring (Information security continuous monitoring (ISCM)):** Refers to the processes and technologies used to detect information security risks associate with an organization's operational environment in real time 
- Packet Capture 
- IP Address 
- Note: Knowing your company more, the more you can protect your computer 
	- Any information should be static, you should know that your Domain Controller information
		- If anything Affects the Domain Controller, then that should be priority number one 

***In Real Time***: Means that ISCM detects issues as soon as  they occurs 
- *Current state* of an organization's networked assets 
- *Vulnerabilities* and threats that attack an organization's networked assets 
- *Effectiveness* of security controls protecting an organization's networked asset

**ISCM Example Threat**
- Employee accidentally download malware onto their laptop and spreads to organization's network 
- Script kiddie launch a DoS attack against a web server 
- Nation state can attempt a code injection attack against an application 

**Limiting ISCM**
Can not protect against every single potential attacks; 
- Financial limitation 
	- Modern Monitoring tools and technologies are very expensive to install, deploy and run 
		- Organization often have strict budgets 
- Staffing Limitation
	- While many monitoring tools have automated features, they often require humans to monitor and respond to detected issues

**Prioritizing Risks to Monitor**
**Compliance**
- Depends on the business's industry, it may be required to monitor and analyze certain application and system activity 
	- Ex: Remain PCI Complainant, Financial business that work with credit card may be required to monitor their application that mange financial dat a

**Financial Impact**
- How a system breach or shutdown can impact the financial performance of an organization
	- Ex: Business like Ebay would likely prioritize monitoring their customer-facing application 
		- Cost of it being compromised and taken offline would significantly affect their revenue 

**Reputational Impact**
- How an Incident would affect the business's reputation among customers 
	- Ex: Online banking provider would monitor their security controls of their customer financial data
		- If their customer data were breached their reputation could be significantly affected 

**Likelihood of Attack**
- While many type of security risk can occur, some are more likely than others
	- Ex: Politically associate businesses that have public-facing websites are particularly at risk of DoS attacks 
		- Given this higher likelihood these organizations should prioritize monitoring for DoS attack 

Note: organization must decide for themselves which factors to consider when prioritizing risk 

___
Activity: Monitoring your assets 
 1 = Highest    10= Lowest priority 
A. ____ An employee in the Omaha office recently downloaded ransomware from a phishing email onto their work laptop.
- 8 It is a problem but we are hoping that there are monitoring systems that can protect against addition attacks 

B. ____ The primary web server in the New York office briefly experienced an outage due to a DDOS attack.
- 8, Dos attack would restrict any users interaction and work. Since it is the primary web server, it is dangerous 


C. ____ The administrative application website occasionally experiences brute force attacks.
- 6 If website keeps coming back which means they have not update the server and it stops people from working


D. ____ Vendors were inadvertently provided physical access to the data center in the Atlanta office
- 5, people can attack physicals and attack with a usb 

E. ____ A terminated employee was not removed from the active directory and has continued to log into their account.
- 8 Hr should be required to remove this user from the system. People can still login to their account which means it may be a serious brench (Still hacking if they sign back to their user)

F. ____ SQL injection attacks were attempted on the primary purchasing web application.
- 5, It is attempted and not successful which means your defense  is good 



G. ____ Last month, an inventory database audit log ran out of disk space and stopped writing.
- 4, Running out of space will restrict a lot of users and meaning that the inventory database will stop prevent future inventory. 

H. ____ In the last several weeks, the VPN logs showed a source IP coming from Asia, where no employees are located.

**Logs**
**Logs:** Record of an event occurring within a device or a network 
- Logs Contains **entries** which represent specific events occurring on a device or network 

**Type of Logs**
![[19.1.0.jpg]]
Red Team idea
- We can turn off or delete logs 
- Navigating system without making any noise
- OpSec: Operation Security -> Move silently 


![[19.1.1.jpg]]

![[19.1.2.jpg]]

![[19.1.3.jpg]]

Note: There is not a complete list of all the possible logs 

___
Activity: What Is This Log? 
Log 1: 
![[19.1.12 1.jpg]]
Net work log 
- Security deceive log, note, this will tell you that you are being attack 
	- Google interesting things like: Oracle.9iTNS.OneByte.DoS (First line)
		- Will tell you that there is a TNS listener that could use all system resources 
		- Device use FORTNET 
			- specialize in firewall
		- We determine they are trying to attack the fire wall

Log 2: 
![[19.1.13 2.jpg]]
operating system logs (linux)
- Watching modification from the system, 


Log 3: 
![[19.1.14.jpg]]
Application log (Web applicaiton)
- They are requesting pages from a website 
	- They are using the 200 which means successful 
- If request are being accepted millisecond 
	- DoS or Brute force attempt

Log 4:
![[19.1.15.jpg]]
This is from Windows 
- source name = Microsoft windows security auditing 
- It is Auditing and special privilage assigned to new logon 
	- Group is changed maybe ? 
- Find the command that change users group 

Log 5
![[19.1.16.jpg]]
Application or System log?
- Application log 
	- Add items to carts 
they only have date and no time 
___
**Log Aggregation and Normalization**
Note: Incoming logs from various source can be overwhelming 

**Log Aggregation**: The identification and collection of logs from multiple computing sources 

**Log Aggregation**
![[19.1.4.jpg]]
- Logs from different source even if the are logging similar data 
- Note: All logs are created different formats 

**Log Parsing**
![[19.1.5.jpg]]**Log Parsing:** The Process of converting the single string of data and into structure data

**Log Normalization**
![[19.1.6.jpg]]
**Log Normalization**: Process of standardizing fields in data from different sources and formats so it can be analyzed together

___
**Log Correlation**
Log Correlation to detect security events 
- Individual log entries often do not indicate security events alone
- Analyzing multiple log entries together can help us detect security events and patterns of suspicious behavior
- Log correlation connects multiple log entries to make raw data into useful information
- Different log entries can come from the same source or different sources 

![[19.1.7.jpg]]
- A single log/ login attempt may not be serious 
- Multiple logs within a couple of seconds might be 
	- Might be brute force attempt 

![[19.1.8.jpg]]
**Correlation Rules**
- Correlation rules are the logic used to identify security events 
- Correlation rules look at a sequence of events that can identify a potential security issue 
- Correlation rules are often dynamic which means they can change depending on how effective they are 

**Alert**: A rule is triggered, we need to decide what action to take 

**Correlation Alert**: A notification that correlation rules have been met and an event was detected 
- Correlation alerts can have mutiple delivery methods;
	- Displays on the screen at SOC 
	- notification sent with phone calls, text messages, or emails 
- Alerts are often designed to notify multiple individuals for faster response 
- Alerts typically provide high-level details of the reason for the alert 

**Correlation rule and Alerts**
Alert Delivery method could be added to the correaltion rulel; 
- if the following is detected: 
	- More than three "Login Failed"
	- Form the same user
	- From the same IP address
	- Within a five-minute period 
- Send an:
	- Phone call to the SOC manager 
	- Email message to the SOC email distro list

things you can do if there are threat actor (We think they are an attack actors) 
- Black list the Ip Address 
- Check their IP Address in the last 24 hour (0 hits = good, 10000 hits = bad)

**SEM + SIM = SIEM**
![[19.1.9.jpg]]

**SIEM**
Two software: 
1. Security Information Management (SIM)
	- Primarily focused on log management and involves collecting logs in a central location for later analysis
2. Security Event Management 
	- Primarily focus on event monitoring and involves identifying, evaluating, and correlating logs to determine security events and create alerts
