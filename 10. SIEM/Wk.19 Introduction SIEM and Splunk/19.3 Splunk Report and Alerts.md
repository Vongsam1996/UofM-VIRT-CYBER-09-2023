Recap:
Spunk three primary methods for accessing data 
**Monitoring**
- Splunk monitors logs from a system, device, or applcaitojn to which it has direct access
	- Business commonly use this method to monitor their production environmetn

**Forwarding**
- Install a program called a forwarder on the system from which logs are collected 
- - Forwarders forwards log from a device into the Splunk system 

Note: Splunk uses **TIME-BASED SEARCH** in which each event or log has a time associated with it 

**Splunk Statistics**
![[19.3.0.jpg]]
Securit4y professional often need to present splunk search results to non-technical audiences using simple format
- IE: if we need to illustrate the top 10 ip addresses from a DoS attack, this results page could be confusing to a non-expert

![[19.3.1.jpg]]
Splunk uses the statistic feature to display specific data points from search reults in an easy-to-read format 
- *Stat* command is the most basic Splunk command to create a statistic report 

NOTE: We will use the *Stats* command to create a simple statistical report of the top account name (account_name) being targeted in a brute-force attack 

____
Instructor Demo: Splunk Statistics 
Uploading statsreport.csv 
- Top right of the screen 
- Add Data 
- Select file 
- Upload statsreport.csv 

Search: 
source="statsreport.csv" | stat count by Account_name
![[19.3.0.1.jpg]]
We can sort by accounts_Names and etc. 

![[19.3.0.2.jpg]]
We can do this a different way
Go to events (without the previous search)
click Account_name on the left hand side and select top values 

Note: We can filter the top limit by inputing this in the search;
source="statssreport.csv" | top limit=20 Account_Name
___
**Creating field eval**
![[19.3.2.jpg]]
We can use Splunk to create new fields and add them to a statistical report 
- IE: Suppose we are analyzing logs for potential brute-force attempts 

**Eval Command**
1. The *eval* command calculates an expression (such as *if then*) and places the resulting values into a search field
2. If the search field does not exist, it creates a new search field 
3. If the search field does not exist, it overwrites the field with the new values 

*source="statsreport.csv" | eval Bruteforce = if('Eventcode'="4740", "Potential Brute Force", "Not Brute Force")* 
- source="statisreport.csv" : Searches through all the results from statisreport.csv file 
- eval BruteForce = : Creates a new feild called BruteForce
- if('EventCode'="4740", : States the following expression: If the *EventCode* field has a value of *4740*
- "Potential Brute Force": Continue the statement "if true, name this value *Potential Brute Force*"
- "Not Brute Force" : Continuses the statement, 
	- "if false, name this value *Not Brute Force*"

Event codes: 
- eventcode 4740 - Potential brute force
- eventcode - Not a brute force
![[19.3.0.3.jpg]]
Inputting;
*source="statsreport.csv" | eval Bruteforce = if('Eventcode'="4740", "Potential Brute Force", "Not Brute Force")*
- This will result above

___
**Splunk Reports**
Statistical reports may need to be run at specific or recurring times
- IE: If an organization is experiencing suspicious network attacks around 12am daily, it would want to analyze tis network traffic every night at that time 
- With Splunk, we can create and schedule custom reports to automate this task 

**Splunk report Demo:**
Following dem, we create and schedule a report using the continued scenario of monitoring brute-force attacks 
1. We were notified that the most recent brute-force attack happened around 12 am
2. therefore, we will run a report at 1am each night to view activity for the past several hours 
3. We'll also automate an email linking to the report after it runs 

___
Instructor Demo: Creating and Scheduling Reports
source="winevent_logs.csv" | stats count by Account_name 
- Save As > Report 

Title = Brute Force by Account_Name report 
click save 

![[19.3.0.4.jpg]]
Once your report has been created 
- click schedule and click view
- Edit schedule based on these steps 

![[19.3.0.5.jpg]]
Click on add actions 
- Send email 

___
**Splunk Alerts**
![[19.3.4.jpg]]
- Process can be further improved through the use of *Alerts*
- Splunk alerts are designed to automatically notify one or more individuals when a specfic conditions, known as a *Trigger condition* is met
- Splunk alerts are *automatic* Once they are created, Splunk's software checks the trigger conditions

Splunk user selects a trigger condition based on the security event they are trying to monitor Trigger conditions contains the following;
1. **Search/report results** indicates which criteria to check
	- IE: 300 logins have been attempted 
2. Time parameter indicate the time period to check
	- IE: Within last 24 Hour
3. Schedule determines the frequency with which these criteria are checked
	- IE: Every day at 12 pm 

![[19.3.5JPG.jpg]]
- Condition is met, a Trigger acitons is executed ato alert the splunk user 
	- Example above

___
**Baselining**
![[19.3.6.jpg]]
Designing Strong Alerts
- Required skill for designing strong alerts is avoiding False positive and False negatives 

NOTE: Baselining is knowing the normal which is highly difficult

**False Positive**
False Positive occur when condition are met and an alert is triggered, but the security situtation did not actually occur 
1. Ex: An alert is created to detect suspicious login activity on our linux server 
2. The chosen criteria checks activity every hour and creates an alert when 10 login attemps occur within an hour 
3. Several alerts were triggered per these conditions, but further research determined the alerts were set off by normal user activity 
4. The SOC 

**False Negative**
False negative occur when the condition is met and an alert is not triggered, meaning the security situation occurred undetected 
1. Ex: An alert was created to detect suspicious login activity on our Linux server
2. The chosen criteria checks activity every hour and creates an alert when 500 login attempts occur within an hour 
3. Suspicious login activity did occur on the server when an attacker tried to brute force the Linux server with 400 attempts but no alert were triggered 

NOTE: Security professioanl can avoid these false results by using baselines to design their alerts 
- Baselining: Method of looking at histroical data to determine what we should consider as normal activit4y 
___
**Setting a Baseline threshold**
![[19.3.7.jpg]]
Baselining is a method of looking at historical data to determine typical activity, known as a threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, an alert is triggered 

**Alert Fatigue**
**Alert Fatigue:** Occurs when security professional receive so many alerts that they can not adequately respond to each other 
- Even when an organization build good alerts and an alert get triggered, security professional will need to research and respond to do 
- If an organization's system triggers too many alerts, even if they are good alerts, security professionals will often miss issues as they get lost in the noise 

Prevent Alert Fatigue:
- **Limit the quantity**: of your alerts to a manageable level for your organization
- **Provide indicators:** of severity in the alerts so that they can be prioritized such as critical vs low-priority alerts 
___
Activity: baselining
Upload alertlogs.txt 
The green bars shows activity/ alerts 
- Normal activity range from 4 - 22  based from the lowest to highest 
- We want to comapre normal acitivty to suspicious activty 
	- any supicious activty ahad 50 attempts in a nhour (which is displayed on logs)

**Threshold**: Condition that triggers an alert 

Upload windowsrawlogs.txt 
source="windowsrawlogs.txt" evencode=4625
- Search eventcode 4625 
	- These are failed logins 

From 7:00 am on February 11,2020 has many failed login activity 

bad_logins will determine the approximate average of normal bad login per hours 
- two per hour 

Determine a threshold of logins that will alert if a brute force is occuring
- 7 bad login within a short amount of time will determine if there is a bruteforce but also it may mean that it could be a customer inputting 7 bad logins within that span
	- Anything within nano seconds could be another way to determine brute force attacks buy malicious attackers can be a timer between each login attempt 
		- But that would if the timing is very uniform then we can determine that it is a brute force attack
			- Which means hackers will use a nonuniform brute force attack schedule which would be more difficult to discover.  

___
**Creating and Scheduling Alerts**
![[19.3.8 1.jpg]]
Same scenario and design the alert;
- Design an alert to trigger when 30 attempt occur in an hour 
- We will run this alert to check the count every hour
- Once the alert is triggered an email will be sent
