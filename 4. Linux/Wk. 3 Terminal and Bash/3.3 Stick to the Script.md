**Introduction to Awk**

**Definition:** 
![[3.3.14.jpg]]
delimter -> What you use to separate by

ex:
![[3.3.17.jpg]]


![[3.3.13.jpg]]
![[3.3.15.jpg]]
![[3.3.16.jpg]]

- anything after "-F" is what a field separation
	- , = delimter
	- delimter -> What you use to separate by
	- NOTE: Finding Delimiter by using cat cmd 
- Ex: if they are trying to find who is ACCESS_DENIED and there name
- awk '{print $5,$6}' 
	- $# -> Where is the the text you are searching for in the text/file 
		- They are searched by "-"

1. cd /03-student/day3/learning) _ awk
![[3.3.20.jpg]]

2. cat Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt
![[3.3.21.jpg]]
- Note: $4 = time 
- Note: $6 = username/ name

3. awk -F(delimiter) '{print $(field_number)}'
awk -F' ' '{print $4,$6}'  Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt >> Update2_Combined_Access_logs.txt

**Shell script**: Complete security task involving multiple subsequent commands

**Writing and Editing Files**
Text Editors: Notepad (Windows)/ Text edit (Mac)

Types of text editors
![[3.3.27.jpg]]
- We will be using nano
	- the rest is still the same as nano but other people will 

cmd of nano
**nanao nameofscript.sh**
- do not need .sh or not, they will make it either way 
- in nano, Holding ctrl + x => X^ exit 
	- Y = yes
	- N = no
- Name editing -> Enter

Must have in the 1st line of script;
#!/bin//bash 

in cmd after making script
type: 
chmod +x _ name of script __
- tells you it is executed

then ls -la 
- Tells you if it can run

then run command 
./_ name of text _


You need to extract/isolate a specific word from a file? Use awk
awk can assist security professionals by isolating specific data points, like IP addresses,, etc
- The basic syntax of field separation with awk:
	- awk -F(delimiter) '{print $(field_number)}'


You need to replace a word in a file in linux with another word? Use sed
- The most basic sed capability is string replacement
- The basic syntax of string replacement is :
