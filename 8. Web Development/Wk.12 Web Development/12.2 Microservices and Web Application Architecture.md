**Application Structure**
![[12.2.0.jpg]]
Front-end
- What people see 

Back-end
- What people interact with 
	- Scripts

![[12.2.1.jpg]]
- important to know when it comes with web designing 

Benefits:
- Cheaper
- Easier to access

Con: 
- If the system goes down then the websites goes down 
	- Updating
- Hackers can control everything once the computer is compromised
_____
**Monolith to Microservice**
**Monolith**: A single machine that host all  the components required to serve a website or application 
- Put a website on a computer; front-end, back-end, databased 
- Con: Single point of failure - SPF. Downtime (Updates/any that stops the websites)

![[12.2.2.jpg]]
- Benefits of Microservices
	- System administrator and developer can deploy changes without taking entire application down for extended periods of time
	- Separating an application's components into their own machines allows the sysadmin to update the front end, reboot it, and only have to verify that the front-end components are working 
	- They do not have to worry about the back-end components and databased
	- if a component is compromised by a hacker  the potential damage is restricted to only that one component

Benefits part 2
- Scalability and resilience:
	- Replication of identical components allows you to serve more clients and provide identical back up components if one fails 
- Isolated improvement
	- Microservice should be reduced to serving one primary function, the can developed to optimize their functionality 
- Rapid Response:
	- Microservice components are inherently smaller than monoliths, they can be replaced and updated quickly
- Isolated Security;
	- one compromised component does not equal a compromised application 

___
**API***** You will hear this all the time 
![[12.2.6.jpg]]
![[12.2.7.jpg]]

**API**: Implementation of new protocols or features onto an existing software application to alter the way that application is used or accessed 
- IE: ![[12.2.3.jpg]]
	- Back-end server can now process HTTP request and responses for products info
		- However, the front-end server still sends requests and responses for customers requesting product info over the open web as usual
	- API Can talk to the Product directory app and inventory databased

**Monolith to Microservice**
Separated a monolith into microservices;
1. Separate each component of the monolith by function, moving it into its own machine.
2. Add communication betweeen each microservice
3. Turn the back-end server into an API to interact with more than jsut the front end
4. Rename the rest of the component services to match their main function

![[12.2.4.jpg]]
User request -> Load balance -> Product directory apps -> Product API (start of backend )

**Diagramming Microservices** 
![[12.2.5.jpg]]
- If any Component of the monolith is compromised, the entire application is compromised
	- Therefor it is separated into the following components:
		- Store app UI to served as the front-end service
		- A user API to serve as the back-end service
		- A user Databased 

Monolith
Front end -> Signing in
Back end -> Someone is trying to sign in and try to see if it is authorized (Making a query)
Databased-> Tell backend server that there is information


Microservice
- USER API -> If there is multiple things happening in the backend, User API separates them as different task
	- 

To make these changes on a diagram;
1. **Separate each component of the monolith by its function and make it its own machine.**
2. Add communication between each part of the microservice.
3. Add the back-end server to an API to interact with more than just the front end.
4. Rename the rest of the component services based on the main function they provide.

**Web Application Architecture**
1st step in creating microservice is separating the components into their own individual machines so that each one run a "service"
- Service, such as the front-end server (Operating system- Running minimum software that was configured to serve one main purpose (handling HTTP request and response ))

Individual machine requires;
- operating system to run on in order to run the service's software and store its configuration 
- Software that runs a specific set of instruction for the individual component of the web application
	- IE: Databased service runs Linux as its operating system and has a MySQL databased installed on it 

**Introduction Stacks**
![[12.2.10.jpg]]
Base operating system (Programs): 
- Alpine 
- Red hat
- Ubuntu 
- SUSE

Front end Software 
- Apache
- Microsfot LLS
- NGINX

Back-end software
- php 
- Phyton
- Node

Databased 
- MYSQL 
- SQL server
- MariaDB
- CouchDB
- PostgreSQL
- MonoDB

**Lamp Stack**
- Linux based operation system
- Apache hands front-end HTTP request and response 
- MySQL stores data
- PHP for back end transformation of front-end request and response to databased queries 

___
**Common Web Architecture: Operating System**
Comparing different operating system available for services; 
- Alpine Linux: Super lightweight Linux distribution that has the minimum requirements to run containers 
	- Other Linux; Ubuntiu, red hat, suse 
	- Other Windows: windows server 2016

**Common Web Architecture: Front-end server**
Front-end handles HTTP requests and responses 
- Primary front-end web design langauges
	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- JS
- Specific examples of front-end servers 
	- Apache 
	- NGINX 
	- Microsoft LLS

**Common Web Architecture: databased server**
- Specific example of databased 
	- MySQL
	- MariaDB
	- PostgreSQL
	- SQLserver
	- CouchDB
	- MongoDB

**Common Web Architecture: Back-end server**
- Examples
	- PHP
	- Perl
	- Python
	- Node

Container - Like a virtual machine but more lightweight 
- Containerization is the process of packaging all the requirements for a microservice into a container
- How a Container becomes a Microservices;
	- Declare base operating system for the microservice to run on
	- copy the microservice's source code to the container
	- set a command that launches the microservice 

![[12.1.14 1.jpg]]
![[12.1.15 1.jpg]]
___
**Deploy and Test a Container Set**
- Deploy mutiple types of containers at the same time 
	- IE; front-end and databased services
- Set up a network for out container so that they can communicate with each other 
- Preconfigure our containers, such as declaring the credential for our web application's database 

**Docker Compose;** to enable thiese large-scale deployment
![[12.1.16 1.jpg]]

![[12.1.17 1.jpg]]
Docker Compose YAML File 
- Doctor compose use YAML to define the containers for a deployment, their networking configuration, and where you will copy files from your host machine into the container

____
Instructor Demo: Docker Compose


___
![[12.1.18 1.jpg]]
Service
- ui - User interface or front end
- db - Database

UI
- Image - Docker compose will retrieve the container image on Docker Hub, which is Apache's httpd container
- Ports - Ports this container will run on 
- Volumes - Local destination where the Apache server will save configuration files
- Network - Network that this service will connect to
- ipv4_address - Static IP address we are assigning to this computer 

db
- Image - container image and version will use 
- Environment - Containers within the MySQL server 
- MySQL_Databased - Name of the Databased 
- MySQL_user - Default user for the databased
- MYSQL_password: Password for user
- MYSQL_RAndom_Root_Password - Location where we are saving our configuration file
- Networks - Assign this databased a static IP address using the same network

Note:
- Do not set up variable (Environment -> MYSQL_DATABASE) 
	- It would would be better if you have place holders 
- Restart: Always -> Good 
- Volume: -db/var/lib/mysql
	- we need a file within this file
- The ipv4 address are privated and sequence (1, 2, 3 and so on)

note: You can use sudo docker exec -it db /bin/bash 
- This will take you into the container 
	- if it has root and random numbers means there is a container 

Do not forget to stop

___
**Introduction to Databases**
Databased are used to store large amount of data
- Examine each component of an organization and understand how malicious actors could exploit weakness and damage the stakeholders' finances reputation and well-being
Databases contain the persistent data that flow through the web application
- Can Include and is not limited to; 
	- Username, Telephone number, email address
	- Personal identifiable information (Full name, date of birth , credit card number, and SSI )

CRUD operations are also known as queries 

SQL injections: type of web application attack intended to manipulate queries so that an attacker can use a databased in ways the developers did not originally intended
