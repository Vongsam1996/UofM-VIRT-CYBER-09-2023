CLOUD NETWORK
Note: Cloud is more expensive than on-premise network
![[13.1.0.jpg]]
**Cloud Architect:** 
- This role builds out a cloud environment for an organization 
	- They expected to understand how to build in security from the ground up

**Cloud Security Analyst or Cloud Penetration Tester**
- These roles must understand cloud architecture in order to test the security5 setting for a given environment 

**DevSecOps**
- These roles are responsible for maintaining production and testing environment for an organization
	- They're expected to build and maintain secure system at every set of the development process 

____

4. personalized provision from cloud providers
5. High availability and fault tolerance
6. easy implementation
7. Affordability

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: A service provider offers pay-as-you-go-access to storage, networking, servers, and other computing resources in the cloud 
- Benefits;
	- High Availability
	- Assurance that base machine are up-to-date at the time of development 
	- Provider-enforced security control, such as basic access management 
- AWS (Amazon), Asure, Google cloud
	- all offer IaaS
	- Note: They give you a browser and manage the cloud - Others will handle the hardware
- Note: They can set up everything 

**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: A service provider offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver application 
- ![[13.1.3.jpg]]
	- Provider supplies the underlying infrastructure
		- Organization can leverage powerful application that are guaranteed to be secure and available, without having to implement security themselves 
- ![[13.1.4.jpg]]
	- Azure classroom lab, on top of which this course's lab environments are deployment 
		- IE: guarantees availability and provides access only to the ports necessary to connect to the labs
- NOTE: We have to put our own software in the system
- NOTE: Responsible to software

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Service provider delivers software and application though the internet 
- User subscribe to the software and access it through the web or vendor API
- The software runs in environments that are guaranteed by the provider to be secure 
- Engineers do not need to worry about secure deployment 

**DaaS/DBaaS (Data as a service/ Database as a Service):** A service that provides a companyâ€™s data product to the user on demand, regardless of geographic or organizational distance between provider and consumer
- The main security advantages of DaaS are high availability and fault tolerance
- DaaS ensures data is always available, even if there is a power outage at a single data center, and ensures that data is deployed as close as possible to those consuming it, reducing latency
	- IE: Company that keep databases of consumers categorized for many different industries

**CaaS (Communication as a Service)**: Service that provides an outsourced communication solution
- Guarantees security by ensuring that communications are not vulnerable to eavesdropping, and provides comprehensive monitoring/record-keeping for auditing purpose 
	- IE: Zoom, Facetime, Skype, GoToMeeting
	- IEx2: Sophos Intercept X, McAfee MVISION Cloud, as well as Azure and AWS servuces are example of CSaaS

**CCaaS (Cybercrime as a Service)**: This refers to the practice where individuals or groups can purchase cybercrime tools and services from underground markets to launch attacks without needing their own expertise or resources

![[13.1.5.jpg]]

**XaaS (Anything as a Service)**: Services providing all the offerings via cloud computing as opposed to locally, or on-premises
- Communication, Data, Software

___
**Virtual Networking**
![[13.1.6.jpg]]
Selecting Available Regions
- Selecting the resources for your cloud environment, you will need to select a region indicating where the resource grographically located 
	- Important to keep all resources in the same geographic region, as resources work toeghter mroe efficicently when the yare lcoated phyiscally clsoe to each other 
	- Ideally all geographic regions would always be available. However, that is not the  case with cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure
	- Therefore, it is important to determine an available region before we create any cloud resources.

___
Instructor Demo: Availability Region Follow Along on your Machines 

Region - Go to the least populated area 
- Asia Pacific Australia east 
____
**Staying organized: Resource Group**
![[13.1.7.jpg]]
- Azure, resource group allow engineers to sort related resources into different groups, each of which can be easily Located by name 

___

___
**Virtual network:** is just what it sounds like: a collection of virtual machines that can communicate with each other 

Adding Virtual Networks 
- VMs on Virtual Network can live in different data center but perform as if they are wired, and provide improved availability 
- Virtual networks can be quickly and easily configured by clicking a few buttons in the portals 
- This is dramatically faster and safer than rewiring a physical network to implement improved segmentation it also results in less human error 

![[13.1.8.jpg]]
- In order for virtual networks to behave identically to physical ones, cloud providers use software to emulate everything a physical machine uses to interact with the network 

**IP Address Structure Review**
![[13.1.9.jpg]]
- /16 has more ip addresses than /24
- Now there is /19 


**Creating Resource Group**
- NOTE: Setting up virtual network, avoid recurring charges by making sure DDoS Protection is not enable 
	- IRL: We want to use this protection 

___

____
**Firewall with Virtual Network**
Security Group 
Azure platform, our basic fire is called a Network security group (NSG)
- We use network security group to block and allow traffic to our virtual network and between machines on that network 

![[13.1.11.jpg]]
- Named - Network Security group (NSG)
![[13.1.12.jpg]]


___
Instructor Demo
Subnet: 10.0.0.0/16
Firewall (Network Security group)- name -> RedTeam-SG
tags-> so you can find it later 

put some rules on the firewall/ network security group
- inbound security rules after you create resources 
	- This will create certain rules 
	- Priority -> On top process first, bottom process last .
	-   DenyAllInBound -> Firewall created but will re make it 
- 
___
**Virtual Computing**
**Virtual machine**: Decide how powerful the machine will be by choosing each of the main "hardware" components
![[13.1.13.jpg]]
Availability Vs cost trade off
- can choose certain stuff 
- Azure have cost-control tools as a free service
	- Setting up

- If you connect this to Azure
	- You can mange all the networks 
		- Reduce the amount of attack surface 
- Jump box name = Jump-Box-Provisioner
