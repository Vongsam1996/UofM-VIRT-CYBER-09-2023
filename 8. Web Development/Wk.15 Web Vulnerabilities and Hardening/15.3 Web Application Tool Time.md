**Recap**
**Directory Traversal**
- A web app back end component vulnerability in which an attacker accesses files and directories from a web application outside a user’s authorized permission
	- Gain access to information that is not for intended users

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)**
- Another web app back-end component vulnerability in which an attacker tricks the application into running unintended back-end code or script that are LOCAL to the applications file system
	- targets local files 

**Remote Files Inclusion (RFI)**
- A back-end component web app vulnerability in which an attacker trick the application into running unintended backend code or script 
	- similar to LFI, except that the script are REMOTE to the application’s filesystem  
	- Target remote files 

NOTE: Directory Traversal, LFI and RFI all fall under the OWASP risk broken excess control  

**Attacking Web Application Using Security Tools**
NOTE: Explore Vulnerabilities under OWASP; Identification and Authentication Failures 

**Identifications and Authentications Failure**: Are risks that permit an attackers to either access or bypass the authentication method that are used by a web application

**Introduction to Web Proxies and Burp Suite**

![[15.3.0.jpg]]

**Web Proxy**
![[15.3.1.jpg]] 
**Web Proxy**: An intermediary between the client and the server
- Internet Traffic flow through the Proxy on the way to its intended destination 
   - **Organization**
    - Monitor and block harmful web traffic, as some web proxies can be configured to blocks specific websites 
    - This will show if you are looking at certain websites that have high malware or undesired websites 

- **Individuals**
	- Provide themselves anonymity when using the internet, as some web proxies can change the source IP Address

note: Router is similar to a proxy 
- Proxy capture a internet network 
- They can have the same information that can be resend the the client
- Proxy captures internet network's activity even if they are erased 

Web proxy are used for network investigation 
- Those who goes to the black market and observe dangerous users 

____
**Burp suite**
Burp suite is a web application security tool that lies between your browser and your target applications 
- Burp Suite intercepts raw HTTP traffic either from the browser or the server, thus functioning as a web proxy 
- Burp has many additional features and capabilities that allow a security professional to analyze, modify, and automate the HTTP traffic before passing it along to its final destination


___
**Instructor Demo: Burp Suite**

Go to the cmd
- Type in burpsuite 
	- Burpsuite
		- It allows us to control commands and request from clients (Like cookies and other network)

Go to the DVMA machine 
- Make sure you turn off the intercept off under Proxy 
- If you have it on 
	- Post - it will tell you what clients are trying to do 
		- Ie login.pgp (log in)
	- Upgrade - change Http to Https 
	- Note on the button- Tells you username, passwor , login
		- You can right click it and send it to the repeater 

Vulnerability: Weak session IDs in DVWA
1. Go to Weak session ID in DVWA
2. Go to BurpSuite Turn on Intercept on  
3. Click on generate 
results:
![[15.3.1.1.jpg]]
This will show you session ID in line 13 
- This session ID is encrypted so it sounds good 

Right click The HTTP and send to burp repeater
- go to the reapter tab and lcick send 
![[15.3.1.2.jpg]]
Clicking send - It will create a new cookie under ( for response send-cookies in line 7)
- sending cookies incremental 
	- Mitgation:
		- Need to send the cookies randomly so it makes the cookie predictable 
		- Even though the cookies are in 10 minutes -> hackers can send information multiple time 
		- If compromise someone can hack into someone's amazon account and buying a bunch of things through their credit card account 


We are going to change the security level now -> Changing it to medium To see how it will work 
- we can change low -> Medium in repeater under security  
Results:
![[15.3.1.3.jpg]]
- This will change the dvvasession = 1704418088
- If you send it again 
	- The set-cookie changes too 1704418151
	- 1704418178
	- 1704418191
- Note: This is converting time to your cookies session 
	- This is will be Unix epoch time 
	- This is bad because it is will predictable but it is better than session cookie 

The best is to use a random number or special characters to generate session cookies more complex 

NOTE: The main goal is what is the importance of changing cookies 
- If cookies are stolen, then they can steal your customer's information's by trying to sign in with their cookies 
- If there is an pattern to the cookies, then the hackers is able to enter other people's cookies based on the set-cookie's pattern 
- they can use brute force as well 

___
**Session Management Vulnerabilities**
**Session**
- Unique server-side sets of user data that are used to customized webpages for the specific user accessing them 

**Cookies**
- Small pieces of Text data that when sent by an HTTP server’s response header, are saved by the user’s HTTP client 
    
**Session Hijacking**
Session Hijacking IE; While using session cookies is intended to keep a state between webpages when a user accesses a web application, a malicious user can obtain another user’s unique session cookies and hijack the user’s private session 
- Conduct a session Hijacking attack, when we used the Chrome Browser extension cookie-Editor to swap session
- Session hijacking falls under Identification and Authentication failure under OWASP 10 

____

**Session Hijacking Methods**
**Sniffing Traffic**: Malicious user can sniff unencrypted traffic then they can potentially capture the session cookies and take over a user’s session

**Client-side attack**: Malicious user can deploy a cross-site scripting attack to steal a user’s session cookies

**Predictable session**: Malicious user can predict what a unique session cookie might be 

**Predictable Session Scenario:**
Scenario: Henry, a Malicious user is using a stock-trading website to buy and sell stocks and mutual funds
1. Henry logs in with his own credentials on Monday, February 9th, 2021 to stock-trade site, then checks his session cookie in his browser setting 
	-  020921MON-1454 (Created Cookie)
		-  Date: 020921     
		-  Day of the week: MON
		- 4 Digit incrementing number: 1454

2. He Logs out and immediately logs back in again with his own credentials, then checks his session cookies again
	-  020921MON-1455 (Created 2nd cookies)
		- Date: 02092 
		- Day of the week: MON
		- 4 Digit incrementing number: 1455
    
5. Henry logs in the following day, Tuesday February 10, 2021 and his session cookie is now
	- 031021TUE-3834 (Created 3rd cookie)
		- Date: 031021
		- Day of the week: TUE
		- 4 digit incrementing number: 3834

![[15.3.3 1.jpg]]
**Recap Scenario;
- Session management vulnerability was that the session cookie was predictable 
- Henry exploited the vulnerability by conducting a session Hijacking attack, using a predicted session cookie to hijack julie Jone’s private session 
- Note that henry to log out and log back in again to determine the patterns of session cookies
	- This manual process can be time-consuming and inefficient

Note: This means that someone that finds out that your cookie are predictable 
- They can create a script and try to sign into someone's session by their cookie number 
-

___
Instructor Demo: Burp Repeater 
Example Burp repeater above 
- Sending repeater 
	- Pressing send can attempt to run the session again 
		- This can show the cookies and try to predict cookies and how their cookies system works

**Burp: Real-World Challenges, Impact and Mitigations **


**Real World Challenges**
![[15.3.5.jpg]]
Note: this demo Illustrated how to determine session management vulnerabilities with the Burp repeater feature, the the real world, we also need to be aware of several issue that we did not cover

**Impact**
If a malicious actor can successfully launch a session hijacking against a web application users, they can potentially;
- View a user’s confidential data
- Use features that are not intended to be accessed by unauthorized users within a secure application 

**Mitigation Methods**
![[15.3.6.jpg]]
![[15.3.7.jpg]]
___
![[15.3.8.jpg]]
___
**Brute force and Burp intruder**
What is the reason why you want to use brute force 
- Other sites has a login page that you want to see if they will block someone 
	- Impacts:
		- Brute force 
			- Customer's account will be locked out, 
			- there is too many traffic request which will make the site slower

**Conducting Brute Force Attacks with Burp Intruder**
![[15.3.9.jpg]]
**Brute force attack:** defined as systematically attempting many passwords, or username/password combination, with the hope of determining the correct result to obtain access in an unauthorized area 
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using lists of username to conduct brute force attack that were obtained from breaches of other websites 
	- A list of Usernames and passwords and try each the username per password
- **Password spraying**: Using a single weak password (like: 123456) against a large list of usernames 
	- IE: If you have all the usernames of a company and use only ONE weak password and try it though all the usernames 


*NOTE: Brute force is the last resort* 
*Things you will try be fore brute force;* 
- *Email phishing* 
- *Send them a google calendar to schedule to meet up* 
- *Call them and use Ai to mimic members* 
- *Etc.*

What is sus 
- normally people who enter username and password takes about 30 seconds per sign in
- Not normal, request multiple sign in within a millisecond

**Brute Force: Real-World Challenges, Impact and mitigation**

**Real-World Challenge**
![[15.3.10.jpg]]
**Impact**
Brute force attack against a web application’s users and gain access to user’s accounts, they can do the following;
- View a user’s confidential data
- Use features that are not intended to be accessed by unauthorized users within a security application 
    
**Mitigation Method**
![[15.3.11.jpg]]

____
**Brute Force Attack summary**:

**Intended Purpose of the original function**: 
- *Web application use username and password input to authenticate a user before they can access a secure part of a web application*

**Vulnerability and method of exploit:** 
- *Without protection on the login page, an attacker can apply a brute force attack to systematically test many user/password combination to attempt to gain access to unauthorized accounts* 

**Unintended consequence of the exploits:** 
- *The unintended consequence is that if an attacker can determine a correct username/password combination, they can access an account that they do not have permission to access*

**Potential impact of the exploit**;
- *The impact could include viewing a user's confidential data within the application or conducting unauthorized activities within the application*

Brute force Usernames 
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt

Brute force password 
[https://github.com/DavidWittman/wpxmlrpcbrute/blob/master/wordlists/1000-most-common-passwords.txt](https://github.com/DavidWittman/wpxmlrpcbrute/blob/master/wordlists/1000-most-common-passwords.txt)

Gethub can have common usernames and passwords 


We are going to brute force with the use of Burpsuite 

Under DVWA go to brute force 
- It will show login and password

1. TRy to give a dummy name
	- Username: test 
	- Password testpass
	- click login 
- Login does not work 

2. Go to burp suite and turn on intercept
3. Try to login 

Then go back to burpsute 
(Make sure you click on clear! )
Go to intruder 
- Choose an attack type: cluster bomb
- Payload position: click on clear 
	- Highlight the username (test)
		- Then click add
	- Highlight the password (testpass)
		- then click add
- On the tab above click on payload
	- Payload set 1
		- payload type: simple list
		- Under payload option 
			- Copy and paste the username into the box 
	- Payload set: 2
		- payload type: simple
		- Under payload option
			- Copy and paste the password 
Start attack on the right side 
- This will have a pop up 
	- the length is 4552 
	- Note: On the bottom left - 0 of 17000 
- Note - line 19 was able too work 
	- Admin and password works 
	- The reason why it works because the length is 4590 instead of the 4552
