Review 
Symmetric Key 
- Only one key
- Have more keys -> 
Asymmetric key
- 2 keys
- only two keys -> They only need to interact with the public key

Hashing 
- Can be changed but can not be read backwards
- md5hash

**Introduction to Applied Cryptography**
**Cryptography and Portable Device**
Encryption can be used to secure portable device like laptops and cell phones
- **Disk Encryption**: Prevent unauthorized parties from viewing the data on the machine 
- **BitLocker:** Microsoft windows uses a symmetric disk encryption program 
- **FireValut:** Macs use a symmetric disk encryption program 
Notes: These Tools can protect your information 
- If you have a SSID -> Would not affect it as much
- If you have a harddrive -> You will see the performance drop

**Cryptography and Email**
Encryption can be used to secure emails 
- Emails are not natively encrypted (Sent and received in plaintext)
- Programs like **S/MINE** and **PGP** can apply public key cryptography to provide email confidentiality and use digital signature to ensure authenticity and integrity 

**Cryptography and Websites**
Public key cryptography can be used to secure websites.
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a protocol designed to encrypt web traffic.
	- HTTPS actually stands HTTP over SSL
- Websites use SSL certificates as seals of approval to confirm a website can be trusted
- These certificates use public key cryptography to establish a secure connection between the browser and the server

____
**Digital Forensics**
**Forensic Examiner**: Cybersecurity professional who captures and investigates digital evidence from computer, cell phones, and other device containing digital data
- Evidence is used in private industry and public legal and criminal investigation 

Forensic examiner make a hash of a device when it is initially collected for investigation 
- Hash can be later used to verify that the digital data was not modified during the investigation

**Steganography** The cryptographic technique of placing hidden messages within file , images, or videos 
- ie: Forensic investigator can investigate an employee suspected of selling insider trading information 
	- Use steganographic tools to analyze photos for hidden data 
___
Instructor Demo: steghide
Note: There is an OWL image named sample-image.jpg -> Lets try to run a secret text message (because it is tiny)

Finding a photo you want to hide secret message
$cd image 
$ls 
- sample-image.jpg

Creating a secret messages
$nano hidden_message.txt
- CEO Password: Money
$steghide embed -cf sample-image.jpg -ef hidden_message.txt
- enter password ->password
$cp sample-image.kpg /tmp
- Copy so we can see it in real time
$cd /tmp
$ls

To extract files
steghide extract -sf sample-image.jpg
___

![[10.3.4.jpg]]
note: Download Car Photo 
- note name of the car is DeLorean
$steghide extract -sf mydream-car.jpg 
- DeLorean

___
**SSL Certificates** - websites 
**SSL certificates:** are small data files that contain data elements including a public key and cryptographic signature to secure TLS connections between the browser and the web server
- To get SSL Certificate: Must reach out certificate authority (CA)
	- GMO internet group (Globalsign)
	- Comodo SSL certificate
	- digicert
	- symantec 

![[10.3.11.jpg]]
X.509 certification is the current standard of SSL certificates for securing online communication 
- Company documents help the certificate authority validate that the application was submitted by the company, preventing scammers from getting a real certificate for a fraudulent website
- A unique IP address or Full Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
	- The public key that will be included in the certificate (often created during the CSR generation)
- A certificate signing request (CSR), a block of data that is created on the web server where the SSL certificate will eventually be installed.

**SSL and Authenticity**
**Root certificate authorizes**: List of CAs trusted by your browsers 
**Intermediate certificate authorities** usually issue certificates and report up to  
a root certificate authority

Note: This is potential

___
**Cryptographic Attacks**
**Statistical attack**: Exploits weakness in cryptographic algorithms by attempting to determine if the "random" values produced are actually predictable 
- ie: Token-generation program that create random number that they use to securely log in to their computer 
	- Mitigation: Be sure algorithms are using random value 

Brute Force attack: Attackers use many password orw user and password comination until one eventually works 
Example/ Mitigation
![[10.3.10.jpg]]
- Birthday  attacks: Exploits the probability that two separate plaintexts that use the same hash algorithm will produce the same ciphertext 
	- Known as collision and hashing collision 

**Birthday Attack (proability theory)**: given number of people, probability that two shares a birthday is about 50% for 23 and 99.9% for 70

**Frequency analysis**: Method for cracking substitution algorithms
- Attack can note the most frequently used letters in the ciphertext and substitute them with the most frequently used letter in the english language (e, t, o, a)
	- After inferring the ciphertext - plaintext can be cracked
- MITIGATION: Method targets standard cipher text cipher 
	- Use more advance encryption algorithms

**Replay attacks**: Attacker intercepts an encrypted message and replays it to the receiving party to get access
- ie: Attackers can obtain an encrypted signal from a garage door opener 
	- Attacker can replay the encrypted signal at a later time to open the garage 
	- NOTE: Flippers and other tools can steal singals 
- **Mitigation**: Add am expiration time for the encrypted data

NOTE: crackstation tool
- Have well known passwords that are hashed already
___
![[10.3.14.jpg]]
![[10.3.15.jpg]]
Download encrypter.py and password.py 
$python3 encrypter.py
- password: a 
	- Result: t 
Note: found out that it is 19 letter apart 

Decrypted cbzhptmm -> jigowatt
$python3 password.py
- `Hi Mr Tannen, What is your password`
	- password: jigowatt -> topsecret.txt


___
**Rainbow Tables**
![[10.3.16.jpg]]
**Rainbow Tables** resources that contain precomputed hashes with the associated plaintext password
- **Salting**: cryptographic method of combining salt (Random Value) with plaintext into the hash function 
	- Salting adding a random value
		- output is salted hash
			- when salted hash is saved, password hash listed in the rainbow table will not match the new salted hash 
		- ![[10.3.17.jpg]]

![[10.3.18.jpg]]
**Hashcat**: Cmd-line tool that can automate the cracking of hashes

___
Instructor Demo: Hashcat
**Scenario with Hashcat**: Security professional is tasked with testing the security of a company's website (Check if they can log in as root). They are able to conduct an attack on the website and capture an unsalted hash value of the root user's password **ea847988ba59727dbf4e34ee75726dc3**. From the length of the hash, they know it is an MD5 Hash.

you can use crack station too by inputting

echo f31663d6c912b0b1ced885a6c6bbab7c > hash.txt
more hash.txt

hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o solved.txt hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
- `hashcat`: The command to execute Hashcat. 
- `-m 0`: Uses the MD5 hash (which was created by Ronald Rivest in 1992).
- `a 0`: Applies a dictionary attack.
- `-o solved.txt`: Creates an output file called `solved.txt`.
- `hash.txt`: The input file of the hash.
- `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`: The location of the wordlist we will check against.
- `--force`: Overrides any small errors that may occur.
