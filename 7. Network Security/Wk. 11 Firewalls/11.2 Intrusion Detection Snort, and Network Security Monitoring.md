**Network Security Recap**
Firewalls protect network by using rules to make decisions 
- Firewall allow and block traffic from trusted and untrusted sources
- Firewalls limitation can be failed through packet manipulation 
	- Ie: send malicious data through firewall by hijacking or impersonating a trusted machine

**Introduction to intrusion Detection and Snort**
**Intrusion Detection systems (IDS)**: Tools that can both analyze traffic and look for malicious signature 
- Unlike Firewalls; IDS detects and alerts of an attack 
	- IDS is **Passive**: Does not respond to attack (only logs and document information)
		- it helps organization establish situation awareness of attackers allowing to harden defense 

![[11.2.1.jpg]]
IDS is located before it reaches the fire wall 
- IDS is dotted 
	- It does not intercept traffic
		- Does not hurt performance 
	- Only created a log

**Two Types of IDS**: Signature-based IDS and Anomaly-based IDS
**Signature-based IDS**
Compares patterns of traffic to predefined signatures 
- Identifying well-known attacks 
- Can be Updated as new attack signatures are released 
- Vulnerable to attacks through packet manipulation
- Unable to detect zero-day attacks 

**Anomaly-based IDS**
Compares patterns of traffic against a well-known baseline
- Detecting suspicious traffic that deviate from well-known baseline 
- Excellent at detecting when attackers probe and sweep a network 
- prone to false alerts 
- Assume network behavior does not deviate from well-known baseline 
___
![[11.2.25.jpg]]
- Example of monitoring and using detection sites 
	- To check network activity
		- Go to a one of the logs and look at detail
___
![[11.2.2.jpg]]
**Intrusion Detection Architecture**
**Network Intrusion detection (NIDS)**: Filters an entire subnet on a network
- Matches all traffic to a known library of attack signature
- Passively examines network traffic at points that it's deployed 
- Relativity easy to deploy and difficult to detect by attackers
note: Packet sniffer 
- It is a copy

![[11.2.3.jpg]]
**Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS):** Runs locally on a host-based system or user's workstation or server 
- Acts as a 2nd line of defense against malicious traffic that successful gets past a NIDS
- Examines entire file system on a host 
	- Compares them to previous snapshots or baselines
		- then generates an alert if there are significant difference between the two 
Note: HIDs is on the computer and create Logs 
- scan your disk
- look at traffic 

____
**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** can do everything an IDS can but respond to attacks 
- Can React to packets by blocking malicious traffic, preventing it from being delivered to a host on the network 
Note: this will stop malware 
- It will do everything what a IDS but more 
- False positive: Lack of availability 
	- System and rules that blocks people who does have access 
		- Creates false positive and decrease availability 


![[11.2.4.jpg]]
IDS connects via a network TAP or mirror SPAN port
- **Network TAP (Test Access Port)**: Hardware device that provide access to a network
	- Transit both inbound and outbound data stream on separate channels at the same time (Monitor real time events)
- **SPAN (switched port analyzer(aka: Port mirroring))**: Sends a mirror image of all network data to another physical port
	- Packet can be captured and analyzed 
	- Packets can be copied from one port number and used in a different port number 
- Note: IDS requires an administrator to react to an alert by examining what was flagged 

![[11.2.5.jpg]]
IPS connects **inline** with the flow of data, typically between the firewall and network switch
- Requires more robust hardware (huge amount of traffic)
- IPS automatically take action by blocking and logging a threat 
	- Does not require administrative intervention 

**IDS Alerts**
**Indicator of attack**: IOA Indicate attacks happening in real time 
- Proactive approach to intrusion attempts 
- Indicate that an attack is currently in progress but a full breach ahs not been determine 
- Focus on revealing intent and end goals of an attacker, regardless of exploit or malware used in the attack 

**Indicator of Compromise:** IOC indicate previous malicious activity 
- Indicate that an attack has occurred 
- Establish an adversary's techniques, tactics, and procedure (TTPs)
- Expose all vulnerability used in an attack 
	- Giving network defenders that opportunity to revamp their defense as part of their mitigation strategy 

**Indictor of attack/ Indicator Prevention System: Snort**
![[11.2.6.jpg]]
![[11.2.7.jpg]]
![[11.2.9.jpg]]
![[11.2.8.jpg]]
This rules triggers an alert whenever a TCP packet from port `21`, with any source IP address, is sent to the IP `10.199.12.8`. With each alert, it will print the message "TCP Packet Detected."
- `alert tcp any 21 -> 10.199.12.8 any {msg: "TCP Packet Detected";}`
    - `alert`: The action that Snort will take when triggered.
    - `tcp`: Applies the rule to all TCP packets.
    - `any`: Applies the rule to packets coming from any source IP address.
    - `21`: Applies the rule to packets from port `21`.
    - `->`: Indicates the direction of traffic.
    - `10.199.12.8`: Applies the rule to any packet with this destination IP address.
    - `any`: Applies the rule to traffic to any destination port.
____
![[11.2.10.jpg]]
![[11.2.26.jpg]]
1. Difference
	1. IDS system: detects and alerts when triggered by a rule 
	2. Firewall: Defends 
3. IDS Mirrored port
4. Perimeter IDS : Put right before it go into your network 
	1. Can have multiple and have it watch certain things 
5. `alert ip any any -> any any {msg: "IP Packet Detected";}`
	1. Alert: Action that snort will take 
	2. ip : Applies rules to all ip packet 
	3. any any: from any source ip address and source port (direction)
	4. --> to any destination IP Address and source port 
	5. {msg: " IP Packet Detected";}: Message print alert when rule is matched 
6. IPS -> Intrusion Prevention system
7. Anomaly and Signature 
	1. It will tell you what is going on 
	2. Alert suspicious activity during certain time
8. Anomaly or behavior 
	1. Normal: Work hours 
9. True 
	1. zero-day attacks: cause damage to or steal data from system affected by a vulnerability 
10. A fire wall 

where is data at home?
- Your computer 
	- Firewall should be the furthest from the data 

inline port
- Slow things down 
- It is moving in a line -> Process data for mal intention 
- ie: Stopping everyone at security check

Mirrored port
- Faster 
- ie: Secuirty check is monitored through camera 
___
**Networking Security Monitoring and Security Onion**
**Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**: A verity of data analysis tools to detect and stop threats after most front-end layer are compromised 
- NSM is threat-centric (Focus on the adversary, not vulnerability)
- Focus on visibility of an attack, not response to the attack
- Reveals statistical data related to specific IOAs and IOCs from attacks 
![[11.2.11.jpg]]
![[11.2.12.jpg]]
- ssl decrypted 
	- This should be in the employee handbook 
note: other things like signal attacks (Bluetooth/ radio waves/ other devices)
- Ie: Amazon go store -> Is there ways to hack the system 


**NSM Stages and Processes**
Two stage processes 
1. Detection: An alert is generated in the sguil analyst console 
2. Response: Security team responds to a security incident 

**Detection**
![[11.2.13.jpg]]![[11.2.14.jpg]]

**Intrusion Detection System**
![[11.2.15.jpg]]
- Intrusion detection systems are generally placed at strategic points in a network where traffic is most vulnerable 
- These device are typically placed next to a router or switch that filter traffic 

![[11.2.16.jpg]]
Network TAP -> hardware port 
- Monitored network -> Can check in the network 
	- You can set a mirror port to monitor stuff 

**Span or mirrored port**
![[11.2.17.jpg]]
A SPAN port is a function of an enterprise-level switch allowing you to mirror one or more physical switch ports to another port. A mirror image of all data flows across both ports equally. This allows the IDS to perform packet captures on all inbound and outbound traffic within a network

**Network TAP**
![[11.2.18.jpg]]
The most common type of TAP is an aggregated TAP,Â  in which a cable connects the TAP monitor port with the NIC on the sensor. This specific placement allows traffic to be monitored between the router and switch
