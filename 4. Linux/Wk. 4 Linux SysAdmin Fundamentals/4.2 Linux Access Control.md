**Passwords**
**Password Hashes**: Hash is a cryptographic function that takes data as input and translates it to a string of different, random-looking data 
- Plain text password: ApPles20Orange3s93
- Password Hash: 579de3a38386c62a1eca4600e3882b8b
	- Hash will always output the same string for the same input data 
	- Password cracking tools cannot reverse a password hash
		- compare the hash to known passwords and brute force it

Password hash is stored in the shadow file 
- When users logs in, has is submitted 
	- It is stored in etc/shadow
		- sudo cat /etc/shadow
		- cybersecurity 

john sally_has.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/worlists/rockyou.txt 
- Brute- force password from list by comparing list from the text  
- ![[4.2.17.jpg]]
- password is 123456 
	- 

Passwords hash can still be hacked by **brute force attacks**
**Brute force attack**: Wordlist of potential passwords and create hashes for each one 
- More random and lengthy the password, the longer it will take to crack

- **John the Ripper** 
	- Modern password cracking software works using steps above

	- After running and cleaning part 2 (Note: deleted Sally and Adam's password)
	- John syntax
		-john <pust_hash_file_name_here> --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
john shadow_copy --show 
				- The word list 'rockyou.txt' has a list of password (can also be found on github) and compared =it to Billy, max, and jack password hash and was able to find their credential 
					- This information can be found 
					- https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords Can download and use this list to brute force information 

**Privileges, roots, sudo, and su**
**sudo**
![[4.2.3.jpg]]

**Switching Users and elevating privileges**
![[4.2.4.jpg]]
- Can get higher permission
- User-> Regular people and do not have administrationpower
	- can not change root and etc
	- They are Groups 
		- notes: admin can be in groups and can access to certain information
- Root -> Have the ability to access any information regardless of admin privilege's 
**su**
![[4.2.5.jpg]]
- su -> Switch users
	- 'su [username]'
- su -> root (will have problems)
	- need to sudo su
		- This will switch you to root 
		- cybersecurity 

**root access**
![[4.2.6.jpg]]
- sudo - superruser do 
	- Do not give to administrator or anyone who is happy clicking

visudo  (Edits the sudoers file)
We do not use nano, we used visudo 
- 
![[4.2.20.jpg]]
- To find what person needs id, 
	- type in cmd 'id'
	- Can find gid or group id 
		- Group number has an id or name 

- Cmd to search for permisison for other people as admin 
-  sudo -l -U [name]
- nano name of text
	- sudo -l -U max 
	- sudi -l -U sally
To swtich to a person, 
- su max 
	- password: welcome 
		- Note this was founded from the last activity 
			- used rockyou.txt

**User and Groups**
sysadmin must know how to add and remove users to a system, add and remove groups, and add or remove users from groups 
- groups can be used to assigned by people 
	- accountant, marketing, etc

**Id command**
1. Linux assoicates a specific number with each user, known as the *user ID (UID)*
2. When Linux needs to identify a user, it uses the UID, now the username 
3. System users have the UID that is less than 1,000 
4. Standard users have a UID that is greater than 1,000 
5. The root user always has the UID of 0

- You can find other people's Id by typing
	- id -u [user name]
		- -u = user for 'id'
the number id

uid - user id 
- sysadmin - in the name because we can edit 
- users will start at 1000 
	- assumption will be first user will be an admin 

gid - group id

usually gid and uid are the same 

how to find all username with passowrd

sudo cat /etc/shadow 
- Note it does not have id 
- can grab name by awk -F':' '{print $1}'

sudo cat etc/passwd 
- This is nice because you can see user id
![[4.2.21.jpg]]

max 
- user id 1006
- book id 1008 
- /home/max has a home folder 

saned 
- Does not have admin permission

![[4.2.22 1.jpg]]
Grabbing user name, uid,  gid 
sudo cat /etc/passwd | awk -F' ' '{print $(field_number)}' 

sudo cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1, $3, $4}'

![[4.2.14.jpg]]
sudo usermod -G hax0rs sally 
- -G = Group 
- hax0rs = target group
- sally = move sally into hax0rs 

gorup sally 
- see sally in group 

sudo groupadd -G testgroup sally 
group sally 
- sally will be in testgroup 
- can be used to add and remove groups which is a problem-

sudo udermod -G sally sally 
moving sally back to her own group
