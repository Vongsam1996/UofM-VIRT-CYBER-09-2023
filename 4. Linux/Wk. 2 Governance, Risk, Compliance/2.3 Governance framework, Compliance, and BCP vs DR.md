![[2.3.9.jpg]]
![[2.3.10.jpg]]

**Possible disruption or disaster?**
1. Cyberattacks
2. Human Errors 
3. Environment Disaster

![[2.3.11.jpg]]

Business continuity planning: 
- May have extra networks/ WiFi to process credit information offline 
- Con - Extra cost 
- Must do impact analyst to see the significant   

Disaster Recover: 
- Flooding and all computers are under water
- What are you going to do?

**BCP** and **DR** begin with a contingency planning policy and business impact analysis

![[2.3.12.jpg]]

**Low:** Have effects and not too bad

**Moderate:** Serious adverse effects 
- Bad but possible for your company to bounce back 

**High:** Super bad to the point where government will have to bail you out 
- Enough to be bankrupt or cost of large is too major

**Recovery Point objective:** Amount of data that business can afford to lose or recover 
- Depended on most recent backup 
- Weekly backup can recover 1 week’s loss of data

![[2.3.14.jpg]]

![[2.3.15.jpg]]

**Maximum tolerable downtown (MTD):** Total amount of time a system can afford to be unavailable for user and business
**- Recovery time objective (RTO):** Maximum tolerable amount of time needed to bring all critical system back online 
**- Work recovery time (WRT)** time available to get the system working again, WRT is the remainder of the MTD after the RTO. 
- If MTD = 4 days and RTO = 1, WRT = 3 day

![[2.3.16.jpg]]

**Hot Site:** Ready all time 
- Ex: Produce phones -> Can call them and build them a quick phone 

**Cold site:** Do not have everything 
- Cheapest but not ideal

RTO: Recovery time objective
- Getting new systems
- Rebooting cash register 
- Take about 30 minutes - hour 

RPO: Recovery point objective

	- Failed over 
		- Transfer to a different site without stopping time 

Plan implementation and testing
