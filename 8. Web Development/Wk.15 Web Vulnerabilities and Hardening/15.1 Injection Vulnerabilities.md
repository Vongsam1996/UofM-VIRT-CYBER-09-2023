**Intended**
**Intended:** Functionality of the sample webpage allows users to purchase different widgets at various prices 
- Prices of widgets (Programs) are set to intended price

**Unintended:** Malicious user could exploit web application vulnerability and created unexpected results 
- IE: Changing price of all widgets (programs) to 1 cent

**OWASP Top 10**
**OWASP: Open Web Application Security Projects**
- Nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software through community-led open-source software project 
Note: OWASP is telling companies what are the top 10 attacks through cyber security

![[15.1.1.jpg]]
- OWASP top 10 represent a consensus from the OWASP community of the most common and critical security risks to web application 
	- Created to educate software developers, designers, architects, managers, and organization about the consequences of web application security weakness 
	- Developed through industry surveys completed by over 500 individuals from hundreds of organization and over 100,000 real-world application and APIs 

A01: Broken Access Controls 
- Access information that some people have access too
- IE: Sign into a normal users by tokens and admins using tokens for their admins 
	- They 
- IE: Cloning tokens and information from someone and giving access to someone (They might have admin control)

A02: Cryptographic failure 
- Cryptographic is implicated but it is not working 

A03: Injection
- Using specials characters in username sections that can break/ confuse the system 

NOTE: Input validation: Making sure what users are inputting 

![[15.1.2.jpg]]
- Cover many web application vulnerabilities and demonstrate how to exploit them
	- Familiarity with these vulnerabilities and the methods used to exploits them are important skills for several cybersecurity career 

**Injections A03**
**Injection** attacks is when an attacker supplies untrusted input to and application 
- Malicious input known as a **payload** (Contains malicious data or code that is then processed as part of a query or command that alters the way a program is intended to function)

![[15.1.3.jpg]]
- Injections commonly occur in fields and form on web applications, where malicious code can be injected 

**Types of Injection**
1. **Cross-Site Scripting:** Injection is a submitted user input that can run malicious scripts against the website 
	1. It depends on the application modifying's the client-side code with a user's inputs 
		1. IE: you can Use a key logger to collect informations (Code has to be in the client)
2. SQL Injections
	1. In this Injection type, a submitted user input can run SQL commands against a database it depends on the application running queries against a SQL databased 
		1. IE: Code can be on the website (Program -> Running ' ' or any other special characters in username )
Note: Injection involve submitting an untrusted input (How application work with input depends on their design architecture and functionality

**SQL Refresher and Unintended SQL Queries**
- SQL Injection 
	- SQL injections works against an application by sending requests to a SQL database through user input
	- It is conducted by inserting malicious SQL statement into field on a web application 

![[15.1.4.jpg]]
- Learn how to conduct SQL injection attacks
	- We need to understand what happen behind the scenes as an application interacts with a databased

Example: 
DB Fiddle:
![[15.1.15.jpg]]
- Line 11 User Id = 1, 1st name: Admin, Last name: Admin
	- Step 1 of looking for user: 
	- Select [first_name], [last_name], [password] FROM users WHERE user_id = '1'
		- If data is true, then it gives you data
	- Step 2: 
	- Select [first_name], [last_name], [password] FROM users WHERE user_id = '1' OR '1' = '1'
		- This line will make the data is true 
		- Give me data if table exist
		- The output will be true which means it will give you all the data 
	- Step 3
		- Select [first_name], [last_name], [password], user_id FROM users WHERE user_id = 'phil' OR 'phil' = 'phil'
			- This will also work even if phil is not in the data table 
				- Give us results when
NOTE: Make sure if your data is absolutely true so no one would prevent this from happening

**HTML and JavaScript**
**Cross-site scripting (XSS)** is another injection type that occurs when an application takes in malicious user input which inadvertently executes user-supplied code

XSS Scenario
![[15.1.20.jpg]]
- AwesineBikes.com is an online message board intended for user to recommend bike models, ask questions, and chat about everything related to cycling 

![[15.1.21.jpg]]
- However, because this iste is vulnerable to injection attacks, a malicious user can unput a script in 

![[15.1.24.jpg]]
- Once the attacker posts the redirect script, subsequent visitors to AwersomeBikes.com will be redirected to coolbikes.net, a malicious spoof site that tries to scam customers

**XSS Impacts**
![[15.1.27.jpg]]
- Depending on the specific script that the user inputs, the impact on subsequent visitors can include a number of potential actions 
- Why do we are about cookies 
	- Privilege collections 
		- Allows you to access that information and ship items to certain sites 

Watering Hole: Putting a keylogger on common traffic sites like amazon or youtube 


HTML: Language used to build the structure of a webpage 
JavaScript: Language used to make webpages interactive and dynamic 

**HTML**

**Testing XSS on Web Application** 
A03- Injections 
**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a web application attack that injects malicious scripts into vulnerable web applications, impacting the users of the web application 
- sending a script 

Injections 
- Random special text

**Reflecting (non-Persistent) XSS**
- Depends on the user input being immediately returned to the user and not stored on the application's servers 
	- Results 
	- ![[15.1.33.jpg]]
**Stored (Persistent) XSS**
- Depends on the user input being stored on the application's server and later retrieved by a victim accessing the web applications 
	- Result 
	- ![[15.1.34.jpg]]

___
Instructor Demo: Stored XSS

___
**Stored XSS Recap**
- Stored XSS depends on the application storing the user input on the web application's server 
	- An attacker submits a malicious input (or payload) into the web application
	- The malicious input is returned to ANY subsequent user that visits the infected page on the web application

1. Example, we added a JavaScript tag to the HTML 
2. Anytime a user visits the page, a pop-up will be displayed 
	1. you been hacked (application)
3. Attacker could apply much more malicious scripts; 
	1. Redirecting the sure to a spoof webpage 
	2. installing a keylogger to capture what the user enter on other webpages
	3. Capturing the user's cookies and sending them to the attackers 

____
Instructor Demo: Reflected XSS
___
**Delivering a Reflected XSS Attack**
![[15.1.35.jpg]]
- Delivering a stored XSS attack simply requires inputting malicious scripts into the application
	- Anyone who visits that applications will have the script run 

**Impact**
Note: Cross-site scripting is considered a harmful attack due to the serious potential impact 

**Stored XSS**
- If a malicious actor applies ** stored XSS ** to a web application, every subsequent user that visits the infected web application will have the malicious script run, with the following impact
	- Victim's cookies stolen and session hijacked 
	- Victims computer infected with malware

**Reflected XSS**
- If a malicious actor applies ** reflected XSS ** to a web application by sending a phishing email to a victims, the attacker can also do the following
	- Steal the victim's cookies and hijacked their session 
	- Infect the victim's computer with malware 

![[15.1.36.jpg]]

Reflect: Target one person 

Go to Reflect XSS
What is your name _ _  _? 
![[15.1.38.jpg]]
- This is the HTML code (payload)
- Add this to the what is your name? 
	- Results 
	- ![[15.1.39.jpg]]



- Result
- ![[15.1.51.jpg]]

Part 2: With cookies 
-  `<script>alert("You have been hacked!")</script>`
	- Results 
	- ![[15.1.52.jpg]]
- `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
	- Results
	- ![[15.1.53.jpg]]
		- The cookie is right after the phpsessid= 
			- Take the cookie and store it 
			- Note this is your own cookie to the site
		- If you make people use that cookies 
			- You can sign into their account or sell those cookies to other companies


Part 3 
How could a malicious user take advantage of the vulnerabilities that you just uncovered? What could the potential impacts be?

- **Reflected XSS:** There are many acceptable answers. If a web application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, a variety of malicious payloads could be sent to victims by using a phishing campaign. Impacts could include the following:
    - Capturing a user's private session cookies if the victim clicks on the phishing XSS payload.
    - Loading malware into the user's machine if the victim clicks on the phishing XSS payload.

**Stored XSS**: There are many acceptable answers. If a web application is vulnerable to stored XSS, a variety of malicious payloads could impact all users who visit the infected page. Impacts could include the following:
- Capturing a user's private session cookies if the victim accesses the infected webpage
- Loading malware into the user's machine if the victim accesses the infected webpage.

How might you mitigate against the reflected and stored vulnerabilities that you just exploited?
- Answers might include the following:
    - Adding a server-side input validation to deny malicious scripts as inputs.
    - Using HTTP response headers that can prevent malicious scripts from running.
