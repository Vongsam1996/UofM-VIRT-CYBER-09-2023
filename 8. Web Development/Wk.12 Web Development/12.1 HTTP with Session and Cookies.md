**Introduction to the Modern Web**
Security professional to understand the web
- Organizations are incorporating more web-based applications and services, such as Salesforce, into their operations.
- Companies are moving their on-premises infrastructure and services to the cloud—e.g., using cloud-based backup services for servers.
- Most people access the web on a daily basis whether for shopping or streaming videos 

Major security roles in Web technology; 
	- *Penetration testers* are ethical hackers who try to find and exploit vulnerabilities and gain privileged access to web applications.
	- *Web application security engineers* must deeply understand how their company’s web application works and how to secure it.
	- *Risk assessors* must understand the risk profiles and tolerances within web applications so they can help companies follow best practices and policies.

**Understanding the web: HTTP Requests and Responses**
![[12.1.0.jpg]]
**Client-server model:** An Exchange of information, a cycle of request and responses between clients and servers 

**HTTP Requests**
![[12.1.1.jpg]]
- HTTP is an OSI layer 7 protocol that websites and web applications use to communicate with user devices

![[12.1.2.jpg]]
- HTTP is used to transfer webpages, static assets such as images and HTML/markup files, and raw data, such as MP4 video or MP3 audio 

![[12.1.3.jpg]]
**HTTP Methods**: Various types of request
- Indicate the specific action between the client and server 

![[12.1.4.jpg]]

HTTP Request Methods
**GET**: Request data from a server 
- When you open a browser and go to amazon.com, the HTTP client (your browser) asks to GET the data that the URL (amazon.com) points to. That data is the webpage.

**Post:** Sends data to a source, often changing or updating a server
-Once your browser goes to amazon.com, you log in to your Amazon account. The client sends  
a POST request that contains your credentials for logging in

**Anatomy of HTTP Requests and Responses**
![[12.1.5.jpg]]
- REquest method is GET
- Requested resource is /js/analytics.js
- This resource is the file path from the domain stated in the header
- the request browser uses HTTP version 1.1

![[12.1.6.jpg]]
- Host contains the domain name 
	- Note: The Protocol (HTTP) + Host + file path in the request line is the URL we see in the browser 
	- http://www.target-server.com/  js/analytics.js
- Connection: Keep-alive 
	- Instructs the server to keep open the TCP connection used for this HTTP transfer after sending the response 
		- This allows the client server to reuse the connection for later request
		- The alternative is performing a TCP handshake (Slower)
- Upgrade-Insecure-Request
	- Instructs the server to turn this HTTP connection into HTTPs so the response and future communication will be encrypted
- Accepts
	- Informs the server that the client expects a JavaScript or HTML document in response, but will accept data of any type (*/*) 
- User-Agent: 
	- Inform the server that this request comes from Mozilla 4.0 browser

**Request with Query Parameters**
![[11.1.9 1.jpg]]
- Query parameters are useful for specifying the parts of a resource to receive or send data.
- This GET request specifically requests articles with two parameters: the latest articles, created by author jane.

![[12.1.11.jpg]]
![[12.1.12.jpg]]

![[12.1.13 1.jpg]]
HTTP
- The response uses unencrypted HTTP/1.1
- The status code is 200 OK, meaning the request was processed properly.

Dates
- Date contains a timestamp of when the response was generated

Server
- Indicates the serer is running PHP version 5.5.9 Lubuntu with kernel version 4.21

Set-cookie 
- instructs the client to create a cookie called SESSID with the value 8toks and that this cookie can only be set by the server with HTTP

Function getStats(event) {}
- Below the whitespace is the response body, which contains the source code of the resource requested in the get request

- HTTP -> Using Get
- Allow: option -> Can interact with the website 

![[12.1.25 1.jpg]]
- status code 401 
- REsponse body, method -> psot
- Input to this HTTP -> input name=user, input password
	- They are try to brute force

![[12.1.26 1.jpg]]
- fake site.com/blog 
	- upload a file from location 
- Was a sucess because http/1.1 201 created  

![[12.1.27 1.jpg]]
- Steal cookies as a java script (get)
- HTTP/1.1 -> sucess 
- Can authorize with the link above 
	- They landed in admin

**Examining HTTP and Cookies with DevTools**
Chrome Developer tools 
- **Understand** the request and response flow between a HTTP client and server
- **Examine** the secuirty implementation of a website through its resposne header
- **Identify** where cookies are used in the HTTP request-response cycle

**Use curl**
**curl** (cmd-line tool) allow security professioanl top quickly test HTTP requests in a way that can be automated while allow them to make adjustments

**curl**: Cmd-line client that allows us to send data to and from servers

**Session and cookies**
![[12.1.18 1.jpg]]
HTTP resources are inherently stateless meaning that whenever your browser request a webpage there is no way fir the webpage to distinguish you from anyone else 

**Sessions**: Unique server-side sets of user data used to customize webpages for the specific user accessing them 
**Cookies:** small pieces of text data that, when sent by an HTTP server's response header, are saved by  the user's HTTP client 

![[12.1.19 1.jpg]]
You visit a shopping website and reqister an account with your first and last name. As soon as you do this, a session is created that saves your name to the site's databased 

**How a session is created**
