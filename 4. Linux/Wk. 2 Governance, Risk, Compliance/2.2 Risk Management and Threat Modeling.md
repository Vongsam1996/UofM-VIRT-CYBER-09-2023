**Threat Modeling and Risk Management**
**Vulnerability**: Aspect of a business that can be exploited to compromise a system's CIA
- Ex: Weak passwords, Lack of training/ understanding of Malware, outdated (lack of updates) packages

**Threat**: Actor that might exploit a vulnerability 

**Risk:** Possibility of losing something valuable 

**Risk Analysis:** Understanding the risk faced by an organization, which are most severe, and which are most likely 
1. What are the risk 
2. How much spending is needed to fight those risk 

**Risk Management:** using the result of risk analysis to create a plan for preventing likely risk 
- Note: Decision regarding to risk will be depended on the cost/ benefit/ profit 

**Threat Modeling**: Determining which attacks an organization is most likely to experience, who is most likely to launch them, and what action can be done to prevent them 
1. What is vulnerable to attacks  
2. Who is going to going to attack with what malware/ virus/ bug 
3. What decision will be made to prevent threats

Identifying possible threats, prioritize risk, and planning mitigation strategies 

**Steps:**
1. Determine assessment scope
	1. List Assets under consideration, determine their value, and define objectives 
		1. Ex1: Perform risk analysis for weak network infrastructure 
		2. Ex2: Asset value of web application could be measured by revenue or profit it generate
2. identify threat agents
	1. Determine which attack would be interest in the relevant assets
		1. APT (Advanced Persistent Threat), Script kiddies, Hack activities, Organized crime
3. identify potential attacks
	1. Identify the attacks each agents is likely performed
	2. Each Agent have different goals compared to disgruntled employees
		1. Ex Script Kiddies: DoS a server a server to cause trouble
			1. Premade code 
		2. Ex APT: DoS a server as a smoke screen to steal valuable data
4. Identify exploitable vulnerabilities
	1. Most vulnerable points in system, How agents deliver the attacks, and where they occur 
		1. If network has 1 database -> Company will lose access if compromised
5. prioritize identified risk
6. Mitigate risk 

**Activity: Threat Modeling: Step 1 - 4 2.2.1** 
![[2.2.5.jpg]]
**Today, you’ll play the role of a security consultant contracted to advise a financial technology firm called GeldCorp. Its finance department recently experienced a major breach and have already developed a training plan to address the problem. However, they would also like to make absolutely sure they don’t get hit with another unexpected breach in the future. 
- Your assignment is to help GeldCorp better understand where its core networks are most vulnerable to attack and advise its teams of what is most important to protect.
- You’ll do this by analyzing the business and its assets, then applying the OWASP threat modeling process in a series of exercises throughout the day  

In this activity, you’ll read about the business and its assets, then apply Steps 1–4 of the OWASP threat modeling process:
1. Determine assessment scope
2. Identify threat agents
3. Identify possible attacks
4. Identify exploitable vulnerabilities
You will begin by reading about the business and its assets. The instructions for the threat modeling activity follow.

**GeldCorp Overview** 
GeldCorp is a financial technology firm that helps clients manage and optimize their stock portfolios. They offer two main services:

- Custom Trading Platform: A web application that clients use to transfer money between their bank and trading accounts, buy and sell stock, and enable automated trading features.
- Financial Advising: GeldCorp also allows clients to purchase advisory services. This service gives them one in-person meeting with a financial advisor every quarter. It also grants them access to the live chat feature, which they can use from the web application to request advice 24/7.
- GeldCorp offers these services separately, and therefore runs them as separate businesses. For this activity, you’ll focus specifically on assessing the network assets that these businesses rely on. Then, you’ll identify the threat agents, possible attacks, and exploitable vulnerabilities relevant to its most critical assets.

**Step 1 activity:** 
Corporate Intranet: Refer to the topology below for a simplified diagram of the corporate intranet.
- A corporate intranet is a private computer network that allows access only to authorized employees. It’s used to securely share company information and resources, among other purposes.
- A network topology shows how the nodes, or devices, are arranged and connected to one another in a network. We’ll dive into topologies in a later unit, but for now, note that they are often depicted in maps like the one in this activity.

1. Determine Assessment Scope
	1. The graph; All network is connected to all employees' and customers login 
2. Identify Threat Agent
	1. Customers, Hack activates, Script kiddies, Organized crime, APT (Nation state), 
3. Possible attacks 
	1. injection SQL, Man-in-the-middle, XSS, Physical, Ransomware, Vishing, Back door, DoS
4. Identify exploitable vulnerability 
	1. Employee have access to database at home (Connected to phones)
		1. Credential attacks on their phones can gain access to all database and workstations

**Asset Value and Exposure Factor**
![[2.2.7.jpg]]

![[2.2.8.jpg]]

**Loss Expectancy** : The measure of how much money an organization will lose in the event of a given breach** 
- Ex: Mail server that reduced to 0% functionality during a power outage has an exposure factor of what? 
	- Exposure factor of 1 

![[2.2.9.jpg]]
**Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**: Estimated cost of the risk occurring on a given asset
- (Asset value) x (Exposure Factor) = Single loss expectancy 

**Annual Rate of occurrence (ARO):** Estimated number of time the risk is likely to occur in a given year 
- (number of occurrence) / year

**Annual loss expectancy (ALE)**: Estimated cost of risk occurring in a given year 
- (Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)) x (Annual rate of Occurrence (ARO)) = (Annual Loss expectancy (ALE))

**Try:** With an asset value of $10,000 and an exposure factor of .5, What is the single loss expectancy?
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) = Asset Value (AV) x Exposure Factor (EF)
- 10,000 x .5 = 5,000

**Marginal:** Organization has the resources to respond to breach immediately without affecting day - to day operation/ revenue 

**Notable**: Organization has the resources to respond to the breach but may not be able to do so immediately (May experience interruption to operation)

**Severe**: Organization experience serious interruption to operations, and does not have the monetary and/or personnel resource to respond effectively 
- May have defer revenue, delay, project timelines, reassign employees, or hire consultants to fix the issue 

**Catastrophic**: Organization suffers severe, lasting damage to it's reputation and/or infrastructure

**Risk matrices**: used to compare how many of the risks facing an organization are mild and how many are severe

**Heat Map:** visual representation of the probability and likelihood of risk
- Organization make strategic decision about how to protect the company


**Risk mitigation**
----
1. Required Control
	1. Must be fix immediately and assure that problems do not recurred
		1. Administrative or technical control 
2.  Required control Strength 
	1. corrective control must completely resolve the issue 
		1. Protective control must completely prevent this issue from recurring 
3. Control decision 
	1. **Corrective control:** Redeploy the older version of application, which did not have this issue 
	2. **Administrative control:** Change the way clients communicate with data, requiring clients to change their processes and Lifenotes to change how its application works
	3. **Technical Control**: Implement two-factor authentication, requiring an engineering tea to implement a new feature and doctor to learn a new a workflow
4. Cost of Implementation 
	1. **Low Cost**: Reusing data/system that is not breach
	2. **High Cost**: Retraining/ training employees or implicating new and costly technology 
	3. **Medium Cost**: Already new technology (google authorization)  \
5. Time of implementation 
	1. How long it will take for training (both how long it takes for training and long should training last for, when should training reoccur)
