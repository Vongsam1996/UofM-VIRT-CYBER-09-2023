![[Threat and risk.jpg]]

Threat Assessment: Structured process of identifying the threats post to a group or system 

Risk Mitigation: The systematic reduction of the impact and/or likely occurrence of a negative event 

![[CIA.jpg]]

Confidentiality: Ensuring sensitive information is protected from access by unauthorized person 
- Example: Banking breach releases credit card info to the public

Integrity: Protecting information from being modified or tampered by unauthorized person 
- Student modify official grades for themselves and their friends

Availability: Ensuring that all operating systems, equipment, and data are functioning correctly and accessible by those who need it 
- Attackers disable a website through a denial of service attack

Out of all all the information - Which should be protected?
- DATA at all cost 
	- Can rebuild servers, web logins
	- Can not fix corrupted data 
	- Need back ups

***How to Attack the Wall (Based on chart above)***
Step 1. Assess the target 
- A lot of targets 
	- Users and admins, web login, server, Data can be attacked 
- *Users and Admin*: Subject to a variety of social engineering tactics
- *Website*: Vulnerable to a broad range of code-related attacks 
- *Servers*: are vulnerable to many operating system exploits and attacks 

Step 2. Define Attack Strategy 
- *Users and Admin*: 
	1. Social engineer: Attacker requesting credentials as fake Admin
	2. Phishing: Redirect user to fake login page to capture user credentials 
	3. Credential reuse: Find users' login and passwords information on other websites 
		1. Recycle password
	4. Malware: Deploy malware such as spyware or keyloggers to capture daily user activity 
	5. Man in the middle: Free WiFi hotspot to capture user credentials 
	6. Sniff packet: Traffic across insecure wireless network such as a cafe of restaurant 
	7. Stolen hardware: Steal computer and use saved credential to login 
- *Web Attacks*
	1. Brute Force attack: Continuously attempt username and password combination 
	2. Code injection: code-injection attack to inject malicious code directly into username or password fields 
		1. username: 
			1. uName = getRequestString("username")
			2. uPass = getRequestString)("userpassword");
			3. sql = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name =*"' + uName + AND Pass =" ' + uPass + '''
	3. Faulty Session management: Exploit faulty session management, when developers incorrectly implement code used to maintain login and logout 
- *Server Attack*
	1. OS Exploits: Run on operating system (OSs) like Windows and Linux, are subject to OS exploits when incorrectly patched 
		1. Operating systems are not updated leaving old potential ways to invade the software
	2. Malicious software: Directly loaded onto the server by USB or other means 
		1. Physical attack or Email Phishing
- *Database Attack*
	1. Default credentials: Database management system often come with default credential, which might be left unchanged 
		1. Username: postgres
		2. Password=" "
	2.  Unpatched Database: Database management systems might be unpatched against publicly known vulnerabilities 
		1. Systems that did not update for a long time 
	3. Lack of Segregation: The database might allow a client to look at another client's data 
		1. If all the server is all connected to all database, they only need one server to interact with all the data base

**Security Task 3: Defending the Wall**
Mitigation plans 
Web attack (Brute force attacks, Code Injection, Faulty Session)
- Ensure strong passwords
- Sanitize any input in the web application form fields and filter the output

Server attacks (OS exploits, Malicious software
- Ensure users are immediately logged out when closing a browser 
- Ensure all servers are routinely patched against latest known vulnerability 
- Incorporate antivirus and user education 

Note: KnowBe4 - Awareness program (Automated security) 
	-Movies and Tv shows (expensive)**
