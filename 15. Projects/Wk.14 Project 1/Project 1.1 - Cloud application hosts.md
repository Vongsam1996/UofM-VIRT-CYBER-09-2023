                <p>As technology becomes more advance, so does the ability of hackers. Which is why the important of cyber security 
                   is required for any business or anyone with personal information or credential stored. If your information and 
                   data is brenched, the hacker can use your data to commit mutiple differnet crimes. They use your hardware to mine 
                   Bitcoin or use your ip to execute phishing attacks to the government. If they do conduct phishing attacks with your Ip
                   address, the government will be coming after your assests and information. Cyber security is a must which makes me think
                   should we have cyber security classes within our school system? How about having cyber security defense team to protect
                   us normal consumers? Thank you and this is Sam, Signing out.

                <h4>Importance of Cyber Security</h4>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is always adapting, so it is always good to listen to podcast or the news about security. Try to replicated hacking in your own controlled sever like a sandbox and from their, try to mitigate the breaches so you can evolve your own skills.
