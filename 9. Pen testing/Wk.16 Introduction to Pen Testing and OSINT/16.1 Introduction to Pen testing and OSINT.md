**Introduction to Penetration Testing**
**Penetration testing (pen testing/ethical hacking):** Offensive security practice of attacking a network using the same techniques that a malicious hacker would use, in an effort to identify security holes and raise awareness within an organization 

Pen testing is often referred to as an **Engagement** by practitioners
- red team can pen test 
	- They call it as Operation 
	- They create presentation
		- They need to make notes 
- Pen test can not red team
	- They call it as Engagements
	- They create reports 

Pen Testing will only work if they have permission 
- Security analyst -> Pen Test -> Red team

Planning and reconnaissance 
- Planning
	- You communicate with the company of the restrictions, time of hack and etc 
- Reconnaissance 
	- You look up what they have on google 
	- Their public information 
		- Access to higher people and their badges 

Scanning 
- You look through those vulnerability

Exploitation 
- when you invade their vulnerability 

Post exploitation 
- When you say what kind of  protection they can use for those vulnerability

Reporting
- When you write down what you found with screen shots and what they can do with mitigations 

**Unit overview and Penetration testing phases**
![[16.1.0.jpg]]
____
**Phase 1: Planning**
**Planning step**: Interaction between the organization and the pen testing team
- Helps the pen tester thoroughly understand the client's needs before beginning the test
	- Note: Business most interest is how they gain access to their network 
		- Also what is the major impact when exploited vulnerability may have for their reputation, operation, or bottom line 

**Purpose and Scope**
**Purpose:** Defined by the business's needs and which assets the business is most interested in protecting

**Scope:** defined by which machines and networks are off limits to pen tester and should not be target for attacks 

**Type of Penetration testing**
![[16.1.0.0.jpg]]
**Black box:** No view/ knowledge of target system and network
- Pen tester is paid to learn and exploit as much as they can about the network using only the tools publicly available to an attacker on the internet 
	- IE: May know only the company name and have to find various key resources, like ranges and access credentials

**White box:** Full view/ full knowledge 
- This knowledge allows them to tear apart subtle security issues on behalf of their clients
- Full-view pen testing is most appropriate when the client wants a detailed analysis of all potential security flaws, rather than exposed and visible vulnerabilities
- Full-view testers are given network diagrams, access credentials to the networks, system names, usernames, emails, and phone numbers.

**Grey box:** Partial view/ Partial knowledge
- Regardless of the scenario, the main deliverable for any pen tester is a report that summarizes their findings and recommendations for improvements


**Statements of Work and Legal Indentification**
Example: 
![[Ex of legal Contract. pentesting.jpg]]
Before beginning a security assessment, several legal steps must be completed
- Since penetration testing is hacking, the entity being hacked must consent to the test
- To protect the assessors from legal ramifications, a **statement of work (SoW)** must be agreed upon and signed by both parties

**Statement of Work (SoW):** Outlines the scope of the test, the timeline, the points of contact, and how the test will be conducted

____
![[16.1.3.jpg]]
![[16.1.Activity.1.jpg]]
1. IT is Illegal because we did not sign SoW (This is a grey box)
2. Illegal (Grey box) 
3. Illegal (Black Box)
4. Legal (White Box)
5. Legal (Grey Box)
6. Illegal (Black Box)
7. Illegal (White box) - Azure is not considered as a company's hardware
8. Illegal (White box) - You need to sign into the company 
___
**Intro to MITRE Att%ck**

**Tactics/header**
- Each Header represents a tactic 
	- IE: 1st tactic listed is Reconnaissance 
- Listed first because attack conduct reconnaissance on a target before actually performing any exploitation 

**Techniques/rows**
- Each row under the header is technique 
	- IE: Reconnaissance, an attacker may use active scanning to gather information about a target, or they may search open technical database similar information 

Note: MITRE Att%ck is a "hacker's playbook"
- Virtually every potential attack falls under a tactic and maps to a specific technique 
- As a pen tester, Beneficial to map out the techniques that you performed in an assessment so that the customer can learn which TTPs were successful and what needs to be addressed 


**MITRE** 
- Comprehensive and includes almost every possible tactic or technique that an attacker could perform during a hack
- In your final report, it provides a way to refer to tactics and techniques that an attacker would use in a manner that less-technical staff can understand 
- It helps create more comprehensive report by categorizing specific security deficiencies 
	- IE: Red team successful demonstrates several techniques under the **Lateral movement** tactic, it highlights that tactics as a security hole in the organization 

____
**Reconnaissance with OSINT and Google Hacking**
**Reconnaissance (recon):** means gathering information about your target
- Two types;
	- **Passive Recon (Open source intelligences (OSINT)**: leverages information about the target that is publicly available on the internet 
		- This includes all domains and host belonging to a target that are publicly viewable 
		- Note: This is searching through their network and information that is already post online 
		- NOTE: This is LEGAL
	- **Active room:** Gathering information about the target but it involves directly interacting with the target 
		- Notes: This is searching through their Physical objects  
		- NOTE: This is ILLEGAL
- Conducted;
	- **Externally reconnaissance:** Externally from the target
	- **Internal reconnaissance:** Internally after accessing the target

____
**Google Hacking**
Enables us to manipulate Google searches to narrow down our queries in order to acquire actionable intel 
- Falls under; **Search open website/domain: Search engines, ID T1953-002**


___
Instructor Demo: google hacking

Google
site:megacorpone.com 
- site: -> Only the website of megacorpone

site:megacoropone.com type:pdf 
- This can see the any pdf types 
- ![[16.1.0.1.jpg]]
	- Red team can look through all the sites to see if there are any passwords in any pdf 

jenkin exploit type:pdf 
- This will look up any exploit under Jenkins that are pdf 

site:megacorpone.com intext:password
- This will look for any text that are looking for any text that are passwords 
- Putting quotes around password will have the same results as intext
___
![[16.1.4.jpg]]
____
![[16.1.5.jpg]]
![[Indext of assets 1.jpg]]
site:megacorpone.com
- found set verison 
	- Search for known vulnerability 
		- Copy Apache/2.4.38 and past into google as 
		- Apache/2.4.38 exploit 
			- There are known exploit 
		- Mitigate: You need to remove the Apache/2.4.378

![[targets.jpg]]
- We want to target Tanya Rivera 
	- Developer has access to the website information 
	- Mitigation: 
		- Do not include email or twitter information 
		- Note they are more likely to be target for phishing emails 
			- It is not a problem but give them training on what could be phishing emails 

![[Emails names address 2.jpg]]
at the email is normally; first initial: last name emails 
	- This will show who we can target 
	- Mitigation:

- Replace /robot -> /nanites.php 


___
**Certificate Transparency**
**Certificate Transparency:** certificate issuers publish logs of SSL/TLS certificates that they issue to organization 
- Attackers can exploit it to search for subdomains 
- Falls under **Search Open Technical Databases: Digital certification MITRE, ID T159.003**

NOTE: USE crt.sh on google
- It is a site that will load certifcations for certains sites 
	- If you click the first ID 
		- It will tell you time stamps, logs and etc.
		- What you should look for 
			- common name: Megacorpone.com 
			- Public key 

____
Instructor Demo: Certificate Transparency 

___
**Shodan.io** (it is a search engine like google)
**Shodan.io:** Conduct port scanning across the entire internet and catalogs the results for quick searching
- Saves us the time we would spend conducting a port scan
- Not conducting the scan also allows us to keep our originating IP address hidden 
- Falls under MITRE **Search open Technical Databases: Scan databases, ID T1596.005**

Note: This looks for networks and things that are connected to each other
