Infrastructure of service: 
- Patrice of protecting critical system and assets againist physical and cyber threats 
	- Creating your own system that will protect your and others resources 
- Like: Building Azure machine ( What we are doing today)


Platform
- Like Ubuntu 
	- A software that is given
		- We can not adjust the network but other resources on the virtual machine


**Containers, IaC and Provisioners**
![[13.2.0.jpg]]
Containers, infrastructure as code (IaC), and provisioned are new technologies that provide powerful solutions to some of the most difficult infrastructure management problem 
- Not all organization leverage these tools fully
- But nearly all organization are aware of their value, and many are updating their processes and toolkits to make better use of then
- Potential Employers will consider knowledge of container, IaC, and automated provisioning valuable for both cloud-specific and "standard" systems or network administration roles 

**Containers = (Lightweight VMS)**
- Containers are smaller than VMs and require fewer CPU resource
	- They can be downloaded and distributed more easily 
	- since they're cheap, more of the can be run
	- They're also easier and faster to destroy and redeploy as needed 

**Infrastructure as code (IaC)** is the idea that the configurations for all of the  
VMs, containers, and networks in your deployment should be defined in text files, which you can use with provisioners to automatically recreate machines and networks whenever necessary.
- Can see exactly how the network is configured by reading text files 
		- Tools;
			- Git
			- Apple Time Machine
			- Microsoft OneDrive

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: the concept of automatically updating machines on your network whenever your IaC files change.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Ensures that a new version of that machine is built immediately 
- Continuous Deployment (CD): Ensures that this new version if automatically deployed to your live environment

___
**Foundations of Network Architecture**
NOTE: VM is not accessible because our security group firewall is blocking all traffic to it 

![[13.2.2.jpg]]
- Example of "Secure configuration," as opposed to "secure architecture"
- IE: ![[13.2.3.jpg]]

![[13.2.4.jpg]]

___
**Network Redundancy**
![[13.2.5.jpg]]
- Redundancy vs Budget 
	- Making decisions about network architecture;
		- Redundant system for everything may be advisable from an engineer 
		- Administrator will not have the budget 
- Redundancy - Avaiability (CIA Triad)
	- when Web 1 dies then redirect to web 2
____

____
**Jump Box Administration**
Fanning in 
![[13.2.7.jpg]]
- Placing a gateway router between VMs on a network froces all traffic through a single node
	- Securing and monitoring this single node is called **fanning in** 

![[13.2.8.jpg]]
Jump box is essentially identical to a getway router
- The jump box is exposed to the public internet. In the classroom, we will be able to connect to the jump boxâ€™s SSH port (22)
- It sits in front of other machines that are not exposed to the public internet
- It controls access to the other machines by allowing connections from specific IP addresses and forwarding to those machines


**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: Creates a direct connection between your local network and a remote network 

___
![[13.2.9.jpg]]
2601:204:c401:d10:ccac:787:c4d0:414b (Ip address)

ssh sysadmin@4.196.157.179 
![[13.2.14.jpg]]


____
**Containers**
![[13.2.10.jpg]]
- Setting up a VM as a LAMP server
- Capturing an image of  this VM
- Duplicating this image whenever a new LAMP server is needed

Containers 
- They are considered "heavy" VMs are large and take a long time to download and deploy 
- Clone an entire VM = Waste space
- Only a few files on the entire disk are actually relevant to running the LAMP server
- The rest are just operating system files 
- More efficient if web servers share common resources like the OS kernel and core Libraries
	- Individually only responsible for maintaining what is different between them, such as data in databased 

**Containers and workload**
Containers - As alternative VMs, for handling workloads like webservers 

Workload is a type of processing that you want a server to do - 
- EI: processing HTTP request, converting image formats, sending emails, etc. 

![[13.2.11.jpg]]
VMs, containers are simulated machines that run on a single host 
- Two separate VMs running on the same host are completely independent of each other 
	- VM A has no knowledge of VM B even if VMs A and B were created from identical image 

![[13.2.12.jpg]]
Can share certain files 
- Container A, B, and C can run on a sing le host and use the same kernel 
	- They share those files
	- Individually, each containers only has to contain the files relevant to its application such as the LAMP server
![[13.2.13.jpg]]

![[13.2.15.jpg]]

**Container Use Cases**
1. Packaging server application for easier deployment 
2. Packaging software for easier distribution 
- Distribution
	- Process of Publishing code that you've written, or a server that you've configured so that others can use it 
- Packaging
	- Process of preparing your code or server in a way that makes it easy to distribute for others to install

![[13.2.16.jpg]]
Containers are **Stateful** we can not safely destroy a container and replace it with a new one if it contains data that no other instance has 
- Make containers as stateless as possible, by moving data to its own central location and extracting server/application logic as much as possible 

![[13.2.17.jpg]]
As Stateless as possible
- Can Split container into a set of multiple containers;
	- One responsible for databased (SQL)
	- One responsible for the web server (Linux/ Apache)

![[13.2.18.jpg]]
**Scaling**
- Horizontal scaling: Creating more containers to handle additional load 
	- Make syste more resilient
	- Multiple machines (or containers) prevent a single point of failure, as you can redirect requests to the other machines as needed
- Vertical Scaling: Make existing machine more powerful b y adding more RAM or CPU
	- Vertical scaling has a limit
	- You can only add so much RAM and CPU to one computer before you run out of resources 

___
**Docker**
- Open and free software
- Container hub that anyone can use to store containers or download containers created by other people 
- Docker containers make it extremely fast and simple to install complex server configurations 
- Docker makes it relatively simple to create a customer container

Add this key into Web-1 and 2 - reset password - SSH public key (After selecting SSH public key source)
____
**Infrastructure as code (IaC):** Refers to defining all of our equipment and network with code 

![[13.2.22.jpg]]

IaC change Management 
- IaC importance is keeping track of the changes we've nade
	- we can create code that contains the configuration of a server, that code can be version controlled and easily audited
![[13.2.23.jpg]]


![[13.2.24.jpg]]
-To see changes are made to a server, we only need to look at what changes the code makes 
	- Often this code is written in a relatively easy -to-read language, so we can only need minimal documentation to understand any give configuration 


**Provisioner**: Software application used in IaC setups that makes automated configuration changes to computers 
- Focus on bringing a server to a certain state of operation;
	- Once the desired state of a server is documented with code, that code can be run on one server, 100 servers, or 10,000 servers within a few minutes.
	- Changes made by a provisioner are created using text files, usually written in YAML or JSON
	- Provisioner can do everything form install software to change configuration text files, and more 
	- Common provisioner include Ansible, puppet, and Chef 

___
