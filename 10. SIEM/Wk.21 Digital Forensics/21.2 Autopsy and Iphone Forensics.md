- Database information can easily be transferred to spreadsheets or word documents where it can be manipulated into reports

**Wrap-Up**
As a forensic investigator, you will work with a team as part of a large collaborative effort 
- Critical to understand how to use tools such as Autopsy and how to export data, allowing other team members to perform offline analysis of evidence
