**The Client-Server Model**
**The client-server model**: A network computing model that defines how resources and services are shard across a network 

![[8.1.1.jpg]]
- example: 

![[8.1.3.jpg]]
- **Request and response method**: Two-way conversation between the client and server

____
**Introduction to Network Security**
**Network Security**: Practices and policies used to protect and monitor a computer network's resources against threats and risk 
- It can included;
	- Unauthorized access into networks 
	- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
	- Eavesdropping
	- Data modification 

![[8.1.4.jpg]]
Review the three suspicious incidents at Acme Corp. For each, document the client and server and describe the request and response in simple terms.

1. A hacker logs into Microsoft Outlook with the stolen username and password of Acme's CFO. The hacker sends an email to the head of accounting asking them to wire $10,000 to a foreign account owned by the hacker.
	- Client: Microsoft outlookr is requesting funds from ACME CFO 
		- Email is the client 
	- Response: ACME's CFO will respond to the client depended on their cost/ benefit analysis 
		- Response: The confirmation of the email
	- Suspicious activity: Can be possible back door

1. A hacker uses Firefox to visit the administrative website of Acme Corp, where they attempt to log into the CFO's account multiple times until they correctly guess the password.
	- Client: Hacker's firefox web browser is the client because it is requesting a login 
	- Response: Acme crop's web browser response back to hacker's Firefox stating that their information is incorrect
	- Suspicious activity: They are using john/ brute force to gain credentials to Acme corp's CFO

1. A hacker steals the Acme CFO's mobile phone. Login credentials were saved on the phone, allowing the hacker to log into Acme Corp's mobile admin application.
	- Client: Mobile phone is the client because it is requesting a login through Acme Corp's mobile admin application
	- Response: The Mobile admin application response is allowing the hacker to gain access to their information
	- Suspicious activity: Having a weak password on your mobile phone can cause credential exposure due to auto saving password functions and/or auto fill functions. 


___
**Network Structure**
![[8.1.8.jpg]]
**Local area network (Lan)**: private computer network that connects device in small physical areas 
- Advantage: 
	- Network speed and performance 
	- Network security
	- Versatility

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Network used to connect multiple LANs
- Advantage: 
	- Share/ access resource across a much larger geographic area 
- Disadvantage:
	- Security issue 
	- Trouble shooting

**Network topology**: Design or technique with which computers are set up on a network 
- Machine connected to a network in a specific design in order to properly serve and required performance data flow, and security factors 
- ![[8.1.5.jpg]]

Two types of Topologies Rings
1. Bidirectional: Topology allows traffic to move in either direction
2. Unidirectional: Traffic flows in a single direction 

Advantage vs disadvantages  of topologies rings
Advantage:
- Simple to build 
- Does not need central node to manage data transmission 
- adding devices to the network is easy 

Disadvantage
- If one device goes down then all goes down 
- Latency is variable between device on the network 
	- ex: 1 way communication between 2 device will be relatively quicker than Device a to b but higher communication when b needs to communicate back to A 

____

![[8.1.6.jpg]]
- Advantage 
	- Adding device to the network is easy 

- Disadvantage
	- Single device fails, entire network falls 
	- Latency is variable btween device on the netowkr 
		- Ex: Device near one antoehr will trade data quick but far away will experience high communication

____

![[8.1.7.jpg]]
Advantage
- Communication delay is consistent between device since every node is the same distance from the central manager 
	- Ultimately responsible for forwarding data
- Failure of an end device does not endanger the entire network 
	- node is the only point of failure 
- Extending the network is easy

Disadvantage 
- Number of device on the network is constrained by the number of connection available on the central node 
- Can be difficult to set up if the central node is physically far away from any of the end device 
___

![[8.1.9.jpg]]
Advantage 
- Data transmission is fast between all devices
- easy to expand the network 

Disadvantage 
- sending data to every device on a network wastes bandwidth 
- Two device cannot transmit data simultaneously 

___

![[8.1.10.jpg]]
Advantage
- Easy to expands the network 

Disadvantage 
- If the top node is impacted, all device below are impacted 

____

![[8.1.11.jpg]]
Advantage 
- Highly redundant; if any link falls, and device can communicate
- Data transmission is point to point between directly connected 
	- transmission is fast 

Disadvantages 
- Very complicated to set up and manage 
- Number of links in the network scales exponentially with each single device added to the network, 
	- Filly connected topologies very expensive to establish

___
![[8.1.14.jpg]]

___

**Network Device**
![[8.1.15.jpg]]

![[8.1.16.jpg]]
- Can manage trafficing 

![[8.1.17.jpg]]
- They are dumb 
- They do not who is connected/ can not see who is communicated with each othher
- Send the message to everyone 

![[8.1.18.jpg]]
- It is like a switch for gaming
- switch between teo devices 

![[8.1.19.jpg]]
![[8.1.20.jpg]]

![[8.1.21.jpg]]
- Previous devices work to transfer data across networks 
- There are also network security devices used to protect resources on the network


____
**Network security device: Firewall**
**Firewall**: Intelligent network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules 
- Locations place right at the entry point of a LAN
- Placement protects the confidentiality and integrity of resource within that LAN

![[8.1.22.jpg]]

![[8.1.23.jpg]]
DMZ - Public facing things
- Do not run inside your house 
- Make a section between home and comcast so you can protect your personal information 
___
**Network Visualization**
**Instructor Demonstration: Gliffy (design basic network incorporating)**

![[8.1.24.jpg]]

![[7.1.37.jpg]]
- There are too many load balancers 
- Note -> Do not have any arrows 

___
**What is my (Network address)**
Computer use Binary's to communicate with each other 
- Binary is Two-digit numerical system that computer use to communicate
	- Ex Binary: 
		- 1 = on
		- 0 = off
![[8.1.25.jpg]]

![[8.1.26.jpg]]

Internet Protocol (IP) address: Numerical network address associated with a device such as a computer, printer, router or server 
- IP address managed by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

____

![[8.1.27.jpg]]
- Lowest value of eight bit = 00000000 = 0
- Highest value of eight bit = 11111111 = 255

____
![[8.1.28.jpg]]

___
**Public/ private**

**Public IP**
![[8.1.29.jpg]]

**Private Ip**

![[8.1.31.jpg]]

____
**Subnetting**
**Subnetting:** This process of breaking up an IP address range into smaller, more specific networks of grouped device
- Subnet, dont have to list and assign IP Addresses one by one
	- Use Format known as **Classes Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)**

![[8.1.32.jpg]]
![[8.1.33.jpg]]
![[8.1.34.jpg]]
![[8.1.35.jpg]]

___
**MAC Address**
**Media Access Control Address (MAC address)**: Important network address utilized within a LAN
- Burned-in addresses assigned to network interface card (NICs) and must be unique to each NIC located on the same network
- MAC Address is a string of six sets of alphanumeric characters, separated by colons 
- First 24-bits identify the vendors, manufacturer, or organization associated with the NIC
