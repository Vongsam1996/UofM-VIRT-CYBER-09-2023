**Why and what is a Terminal
Graphical User interface (GUI): Familiar icons, windows, buttons, and mouse pointers 
- Files program, Calculator,  
- Right click -> Go to files 

![[3.1.0.jpg]]

Example: 
Mkdir test 
- Creates a folder named “test” 

Ls 
- Show a list of current selected program/ GUI you are looking at 

**Command line (Cmd)**: Rather than clicking on a file to open it, we can type a command to open it 
- The only way to achieve a desired outcome 
- Work with systems and tools that have no GUI interface
	- EX: Need to configure a system that does not have a GUI
	- EX: Command line is your only mode for configuration 
- Fastest way to achieve a desired outcome 
	- Cmd line has tools that can speed up a task 
		- EX: Develop a script on the command line to automate and repeat a task 
- Most flexible way to achieve a desired outcome
	- GUI is most familiar BUT CMD provide greater control 
		- Output logs to specific location combine files in unique ways, and string together CMD with more flexibility

**Basic Terminal commands:** 
“pwd” - Display the current working directly (print working directory
“ls” - list directories and files in the current directory 
“cd” - Navigate into a directory (Change directory)
- cd /user/program/etc.. 
	- Change directory faster
- Cd . .  (go back)
	- cd .. / [copy paste last directory]/ 
- Cd (go to file)
mkdir- Make a directory 
touch- Create an empty file 
rm - REmove a file 
clear - clear terminal history of a page
su - Switcher user 
- su instructor 
- exit (to leave)

cp - Copy log and put it in a separate folder
mv - Move 
- mv [name1]/[name3]
- mv[name1]/[name2]/[name3]

Directory: The folder 
File: content Programs

**Activity 3.1 - Take give
1. Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A.
2. Navigate into the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder.
3. From within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.
4. Create three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:  
	- email_evidence  
	- log_evidence  
	- web_evidence  

5. Delete the file called web_evidence, as you have realized Candy Corp has no web logs captured.    
6. Display (list) all the files created.
7. Clear the terminal window.

cd /03-student/day1/take_5/
mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
cd Internal_Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
pwd
mkdir email_evidence log_evidence web_evidence 
rm web_evidence
ls

**File paths:** unique location in the file system where a file is located

![[3.1.3.jpg]]

**File paths in It** 
Ex: access a network log for an investigation

Absolute path
**Absolute path:** Indicates the location of a file regardless of your current location in file system 
- Straight path from one location regardless where you are, you must take the direct path 
- Use pwd
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vFkxtlRvmBwPGL1RW3jjH3TdKTyfZB4khGsAhsS8Alz88VpI6xAzGrnUIizqmXC1cERzZzFl8epgbhFkSyQdL_UAzHH3IibXdAWG-f2AIxmh6rjpqinLunYhkmG0OsYA5FeHTFqZI-fWDhWMd_KrQ6g)

Relative path
**Relative path:** Start at your current location in the file system and does not require using the root directory (“/”)
- Where I am 
- Use cd

Moving files 
cp (copy) creates a copy of the file and place it in a specified location 
mv - move files
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UeWv0Y_Xzazn2GJc_FdXlfjF9CTbLB9-AgZamPMPBGkx9KpGcQ6tIM4qMysoBzu8WLsJuKunUwky93o-AKCUKGPAObQ3cTGakxdmLZWnptWJCbTMe_mEoTqAYLdRx-_OsEV-AXFG6xmvrC-STEwqUTo)

**File path:** Identifies an unique location in a file system 
**Absolute path**: Starts at the top directory of the file system 
**Relative path:** Begins from the current directory 

cp: copies files 
mv :moves files  

**Activity 3.milkway** 

First, navigate into the students folder on your VM using an absolute path. To do so, run the following command:
- cd /03-student/day1/take_5

Create an additional folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_B:
- mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_B

To confirm the folder was created, run:
- ls  

Move the file email_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B using absolute paths:
- mv /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/email_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/  

Copy the file log_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B:
- cp /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/log_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/

Navigate to the directories to confirm the files have been copied and moved correctly.
- To check the Employee_A directory, run:
	- cd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/
	- ls 
	
- Since we moved the email_evidence file, the only file that should remain is log_evidence.
- To check the Employee_B directory, run:
	- cd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/
	- ls
	
- The existing files should be log_evidence and email_evidence

You continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp, investigating the employees potentially selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp. Your manager at Candy Corp has identified two possible insiders who may be working with Sugar Corp: Henry and Ruth. Your manager has quickly pulled some files from Henry and Ruth's computers without their knowledge. Some of the files contain gibberish, but some may have useful data. Your manager has asked you to preview the files to see if they have readable text data that can be analyzed later.

The first step is to navigate into the students/oh_henry folder on your VM. To do so, run the following command:
- cd /03-student/day1

Navigate to Henry's Folder: 
- cd oh_henry

There are many files in this directory. You can preview each file by using head, more, or less. For example:
- head do.txt or 
-  more do.txt

Most of the files contain non-ASCII data, as they are actually image files.  

The three files that contain text data are:
- Henry: do.txt sp.txt wp.txt
- Ruth: l8.txt hy.txt ud.txt  

Delete the other files:
- rm dj.txt bb.txt b7.txt sd.txt ta.txt

Confirm that only the correct files remain by running:
- Ls
- The files that should remain are do.txt sp.txt wp.txt.  

Complete this same process in Ruth's folder.
- The files that should remain are l8.txt hy.txt ud.txt.

Bonus
- To view the date on the bottom of each file, run:
	- tail do.txt
- On the bottom of the file called do.txt is the date October 13, 2019. To rename this file, run:
	- mv do.txt do.txt_10_13_2019
- Follow this same process for all the files.

The final results for Henry:
- do.txt_10_13_2019  
- sp.txt_10_14_2019  
- wp.txt_10_15_2019  

- The final results for Ruth:  
- l8.txt_10_13_2019  
- hy.txt_10_14_2019  
- ud.txt_10_15_2019

Data stream 
Data Stream: Describes channels of data as they are processed and moved through a system
- Move data from one process or program to another   

stdin - Standard in 
- Input data is streamed using the data stream   

stdout - Standard out 
- Output data is streamed using data stream

“>” Overwrites a file 
	- Rewriting same file name 
	- Creating new file with new data 
		- Head -3 logfile1 logfile2 logfil3 > log
			- Create file log
		- Head -3 logfile1 logfile2 logfil4 > log
			- Rewrite the first log and will only show logfile logfile2 logfile4 
				- Will not show logfile 3 in preview 

“>>” writes or appends to a file 
- If same label on text then it will double it 
- Create two files that will have different files ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8az-BJbRlRNmYSYG55twH3anW0PPCJC_UO_C7Emgs_oxnIomLUslGrgSvdWNtXjFGubq_GPPek8Aox-bBb2uo4YI9q6zx3VCQwqmK5X9hU3D1jIieVyz16TQ3Wr5Ec2yb5g_LQEV3tv0BpxXkrtxeU8)
