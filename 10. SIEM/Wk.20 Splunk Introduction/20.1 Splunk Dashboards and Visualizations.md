**Introduction to Visualization**

Contextualizing Data
![[20.1.jpg]]
- Ex: Table with number of logins to a web application per minute 
- **Gauged Visualization:** Contextualizes the number 879 by highlighting the severity of the login count 

**Single-value Visualization**
![[20.1.6 1.jpg]]
**Radial Gauge** (RPM - How best you drive)
- Radial Gauges are similar to RPM dial in a car dashboard
- RPM (Revolution per minutes): Single value visualized in the dial
- Dial include a red section that indicate when the level is too high 

___
Instructor Demo: Single-value visualization 

source="fortinet_IPS_logs.csv" host="f9731f3b6921" sourcetype="csv" attack_name="Oracle.9i.TNS.OneByte.DoS" | stats count by total
- resulting from 200
- Stats count by total will sum up all attacks from Oracle (it was given)

We are going to pick the radical gauge (RPM graph)
- Visualization > Format > color range > green: 0 - 200, orange: 200- 300 red: 300 - 500
- results 
	- ![[20.1.7 1.jpg]]
		- Results are 200 so the RPM is staying at the 200 oiubt 
___
Activity: Single-value Visualization 
![[20.1.9 1.jpg]]
source="radialgauge.csv" host="f9731f3b6921" http_method=POST | stats count as total > search 

Visualization > Format

The solution
![[20.1.8 1.jpg]]

___
**Multiple-value visualization**
Scenario: Suppose a business is experiencing brute force attacks against a web application
- SOC manager wants to visualize the list of users being attacker and the number of attacks experienced by each user 
- ![[20.1.0JPG.jpg]]
	- Convert Splunk stat spreadsheets into more informative and interactive visualization 
	- Data found in the spreadsheet can be displayed in a column chart 

___
Instructor Demo: Multiple-value Visualization 
![[20.1.11 1.jpg]]
In the search bar
source="radialgauge.csv" host="f9731f3b6921" http_method=POST | top limit=10 uri_path 

![[20.1.12 1.jpg]]

save as - Pie Chart – Top 10 **URI_PATH**
___
**Geographic Map Visualization**
Note: Organization can monitor where users access the application from to help determine the source of security issues
- Ex: Business knows that its application customers are primarily located in the United States
	- Significant number of users accessing the application from another place is a cue to investigate the activity 

![[20.1.1JPG.jpg]]
- Create maps and gain insight into the location of activity 
iplocation src_ip 
- Ip location source ip 

geostats count
- Count location of IP location by source UP 

note: To create a map, The data needs IP locaitons 
____
Instructor Demo: Geographic map visualization 
![[20.1.13 1.jpg]]
source="radialgauge.csv" host="f9731f3b6921" http_method=POST |iplocation src_ip |geostats count 
- results 
![[20.1.14 1.jpg]]

save as Geographic Map – POST request monitor by Source IP 
- this will tell this how easy is it to make 

What is a source IP, what is a geostat, iplocation, what does this story tell? 
___
**Splunk dashboard**
![[20.1.2JPG.jpg]]
Note: displaying all this information together can provide a security analyst a complete picture of the state of their web application

**Dashboard:** Collection of multiple visualization in a single location 
- Visualization are placed in different section called **panels**
	- Panels contains 
		- Single-value visualization
		- Multiple-value visualization
		- Geographic map
		- Statistical Charts

SOCs often have dashboard displayed on multiple screens in the operation room to provide availability and functionality across staff 

![[20.1.3JPG.jpg]]

___
Instructor Demo: Creating Dashboards
![[20.1.15 1.jpg]]
Click splunk on top left > Search data > Dashboard > name: *Website Monitoring* > Add report; , Geographic Map – POST request monitor by Source IP, Pie Chart – Top 10 URI_PATH,  and Radial Gauge – POST request monitor
- You can use the dotted lines above each report, can display all the maps 

results 
![[20.1.16 1.jpg]]
- note copy and post the name under no title 
- Do not forget to save 

Note: They want us to add a fourth visualzaiton that contains a statistical report representing data from you pie chart 
Go back > history > toplimt=10 uri_path > search > save as uri_path > Add to existing dashboard > website Monitoring 

edit > move uri_path next to pie chart and radical graph next to the geolocation map 
results: 
![[20.1.17 1.jpg]]
- As long as pie chart and data is right next to each other, we should be fine 
	- We can adjust to make it look nicer 
	- Results;
		- ![[20.1.18 1.jpg]]



___
**Drilldowns and Dashboard Interactivity**
![[20.1.4 1.jpg]]
Similar to many other application in splunk, dashboard have advanced features that can help information security professional research security issues 

as a SOC manager, you created a three-panel dashboard to monitor your windows server
![[20.1.5 1.jpg]]
You will expand the functionality of this dashboard by;
- Modifying the date and time ranges being analyzed directly on teh dashboard
- adding a drilldown into the visualization to assist with further analysis 

NOTE: we want the dash board in real time 
___
Instructor Demo: Drilldowns and Dashboard Interactivity 
![[20.1.19 1.jpg]]
edit > Add input > time ( pick a time) 
- Note : we need to change the panels to use the share time 
	- edit mode > On one panel > 3 dots on the side > edit drilldown > custom > time range: shared time picker 

NOTE: It did not work when we tried to do edit each panel to shared time picker 
___
