Apps, add-ons, and suites
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/
- This will show you how to deploy splunk
	- You can call splunk to guide you through this 
- you can search apps, add-on, and suites 
	- You can look for siems for quality of life
	- 
___
Instructor Demo: splunk app and add-on + Activtiy: Splunk + Instructor Demo: Splunk Tour 

Searching for apps and other things 
- We can call Splunk if the company is paying a high amount of money 
- We can get firewalls logs
	- *Fortinet FortiGate App for Splunk*
		- It shows firewall logs and see if things are

Note: If people are claiming that the network is slow 
- We can use the APP: *Forinet FortiGate App for Splunk* to check logs
	- If we notice there is a bunch of activity then we know someone is trying to access your firewall
		- Of we are at the message sentence 
			- We can look for a local or public ip address
				- Public is not good because it is their network 

___
**Tour of Splunk**
We are going to navigate to splunk logs and unzip logs.zip by 
 cd /splunk/logs
unzip logs.zip

Navigate to splunk.sh 
cd ..
cd ..
sudo /splunk/splunk.sh

**Splunk Architecture basic**
1. The Indexer (Explore Splunk Enterprise > Add Data)
	- Splunk transforms incoming data into events 
	- Splunk adds these events into repositories called index
	- Indexer are used to add events to indexes and search through the data
2. The search head (Setting > Add Data)
	- The search head is Splunk's GUI that we use to conduct search's 
	- It manages search requests to the indexer and provides the search result back to the user 

Adding Data: Data Source
1. Ex: Splunk user may want to add palo Alto Firewall log into splunk 
2. The Palo Alto option under Networking is an examplke of a data type 
3. Based on the option selected an add-on may be provided or settings configured

**Uploading Data into Splunk**
1. Manager has reported some suspicious login activity on your Linux server
2. They provide you with the login activity from your Linux servers
3. you must upload them into splunk so they can be analyzed 

___
Instructor Demo: Data upload 
Results:
![[19.2.0.2.jpg]]

**Add data (We are adding data from the zip file (this is the security engineer))**
upload button 
- Go to other location
	- Splunk
		- Logs 
		- Week 1 - Day 2 logs 
		- Add .txt files (zipped logs files)

NOTE: when uploading win_security_event.txt
- The name you choose was; "Win_Security_Events.txt"
Follow the green button because we are not changing anything 

Go to Search and reporting on the left side 
![[19.2.0.3.jpg]]
This is a search bar (Searching for queries)
- If you upload the data; then you should have it if you search for ALL 
	- If they are not there then there is typos in your quires 

in the search bar
source="nessus.txt"
source="carbon_black.txt
source="win_security_events.txt"
- Shown thousand events ( based on the green bar

We are going to look at source="nessus.txt"
**nessus.txt**
- What is it??? 
- What system sent me this log and what does it do 
	- Nessus is a vulnerability scanner 
- Every event (time)
![[19.2.0.4.jpg]]

Left side 
- Hosts - what is running nessus 
- Source - File 
- Sourcetype - nessus

Interesting field 
- This shows fields that might have system 
- Events for severity 
	- severity_id 

Operationing system????
- OS 
	- If onyl click for Cisco_Router 
		- Change Search bar to
			- source="nessus.txt" os="Cisco_Router"

___
**Searching with Splunk**
Using splunk queries to find specific helpful information about a security event 
- IE: We can use Splunk 
	- Determine the primary IP that is being attacked during a DDoS attack
	- Determine the User Id that is being used in a brute-force attack 

User can use the following; 
**Real-time Search**: Returns a window of real-time data as it is happening and continues to update as the events occur 

**Relative search**: Return Data by date, date range, time, or time range 
- Results will not change even if more events occur

**All time**: Returns all available dat abased on the search

Note: Splunk queries are designed using a coding language called **Splunk Processing Language (SPL)**

**Key-value Pairs**
![[19.2.3.jpg]]
**Key-value pairs:** Most common method used to search for data, match keywords with specific information (values)
- Want to find user named Jonathan in your search results you would design the following search 

**Wildcard**
![[19.2.5.jpg]]
![[19.2.6.jpg]]

**Boolean Expressions**
![[19.2.7.jpg]]
SPL uses Boolean Expressions and, or, and not to assist in searching for specific data

![[19.2.8.jpg]]

___
Activity: SPL search

___
**Searching Fields with Splunk**
Note: We do not know the values or the format of the values that exist in the search result 
- each companies have their own key and value names 

**Complexities of SPL Queries**
Possible Keys: 
- Activity 
- Event_type
- User_activity

Possible values;
- Login
- Logon
- Logged in 
___
**Instructor Demo: Splunk Field** 
![[19.2.0.0.1.jpg]]

source="nessus.txt" OS="[*]Window[*]"
- Click OS and click on a random windows to know where to input queries 
	- Then change it with wild card between windows 
	- Results: 408 searched results 

source="nessus.txt" os="[*]windows[*]"

source="nessus.txt" dest_ip="10.11.36.4"
- click on dest_ip on the left side 
	- Choose any Ip to see the queries search
		- Then replace the dest_ip = value 
		- Then erase the os="[*]windows[*]"

source="nessus.txt" dest_ip="10.11.36.*"
- Erase 4 
	- Then add wildstar

NOTE THIS IS CALLED SPL - Splunk process Language
___
**Search Field**
When files are uplaoded and parsed, the data is sparated into fields, as shown on the keft side of splunk's search page 

![[19.2.9.jpg]]

___
**Advanced Searches with Piping**
![[19.2.10.jpg]]
Adding piping to our SPL queries to modify or adjust the display of the results or to create custom reports 


___
Instructor Demo: SPL Piping

___
**Activity: Advance Searches with piping**
![[19.2.0.0.2.jpg]]

upload winevent_logs_2.csv
![[19.2.0.0.3.jpg]]
we can remove the host and sourcetype to make our search clean 

1.1 - Account successfully logged on
google 
windows logsAn splunk an account was successfully logged on
- eventcode = 4624 
- source="winevent_logs_2.csv" host="f9731f3b6921" sourcetype="csv" EventCode=4624
Answer:  source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="An account was successfully logged on"

1.2 User account was changed 
- source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="A user account was changed"

1.3 Secuirty access was granted to an account
- source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="System Security access was granted to an account"

1.4 Security access 3was deleted
- source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="A user account was deleted"

1.5 user was locked out
- source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="A user account was locked out"

2 Account_name that has majority of the activity records- Which activity type is it? 
source="winevent_log2.csv" | sort Account_name
- Event actions -> user 
source="winevent_log2.csv" | sort user

- user_d 

3 Desgin an SPL query to present the result to your manager with the following information: (activity type found in step 2, primary account_name, simplify quiery results only show top 50 rows sorted by ComputerName )
- source="winevent_log2.csv" name="A user account was changed" | head 50 | sort ComputerName
