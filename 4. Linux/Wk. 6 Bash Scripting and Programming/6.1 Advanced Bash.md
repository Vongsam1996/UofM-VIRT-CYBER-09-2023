**Creating Compound Commands**
Why Compound Commands
- Navigating Linux directories, quickly searching large log files, and writing small scripts to automate task will save time and energy 
**Compound commands**: Several individual commands linked together
- ex:![[6.1.0.jpg]]

Using Semi-colon
![[6.1.2.jpg]]
; will run all cmd regardless if the previous command does not work 


**Using &&**
![[6.1.3.jpg]]
![[6.1.4.jpg]]
&& is better than ;
- It will run each sequence but stops if there is a cmd that can not be run 
	- So it will inform you if your command is working or not 
- if you make a directory, It will move you into the next file 

Since there is a mispell 'dor' 
- It will run mkdir dir 
	- but stop cd dor 
	- Will not make a fouc file and check the ls

1.Create a research directory and copy all system logs along with the `shadow`, `passwd`, and `hosts` files in one long command. 
$mkdir ~/research && sudo cp -r /var/log/* /etc/shadow /etc/passwd/ /etc/hosts ~/research 
	- mkdir is the first part
	- -r : it will ask you to copy all txt and etc in log directory 
	- /log/* : Asking to copy all logs in directory 
	- ~/research: (1st ) -> Creating directory
	- ~/research: (2nd) -> Copy those files into new directory 
- Need to add sudo infront of cp because those files are 
	- still wont work because there is a research file 
$rm -r research/ 
	- remove directory and everything side \
$mkdir ~/research && sudo cp -r /var/log/* /etc/shadow /etc/passwd/ /etc/hosts ~/research

2.Create a list of all files with `777` permissions in the home folder and save it to a text file in the research folder with one long command.
- Need to use the find command 
	- Google find 777 all linux 
		- find /home/ -perm 777 
			- Do not want home
$sudo find /home/ -perm 777 -type f 2>/dev/null > ~/research/777.txt 
- -type f: type of file 
- 2>/dev/null: ignore all errors

3.Create a list of the 10 most active processes. The list should only contain the `USER`, `PID`, `%CPU`, `%MEM` and `COMMAND`. Save this list to a text file in your research directory with one long command.
- google create list of 10 most active process

$ps -aux
- Runing all user execute
- list all process
- over 10 most active processes

first part
$ps -aux --sort %cpu | head -11
- --sort %cpu: looking at active process?? memeory or cpu??
- head -11 look at the top 10 and the title/ header 
![[5.1.21.jpg]]
- not separated by user, PID, %cpu
	- so use awk 
$ps -aux --sort %cpu | head -11 | awk {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11}

**Changing Aliases**
Aliases are custom commands that launch our compound command
	- ls ~/downloads
		- ~ is every directory downloads
- Aliases gives you a short cut 

example: you want to give the command down to go to downloads 
	-$alias down='ls /home/sysadmin/Downloads'
		it will show what is in your file

example 2: you want to show the date in a different lanuage
- nguva is translated to time/date 

$alias nguva='date'
- Show the date and time 

Where are the Aliases stored? 
$bash 
- give you a fresh terminal 

$ls -la 
- will find hidden file
	-.bashrc
		-ANTHING WITH A  . will have be a hidden file 
		bashrc will show you all alias  
- note if you make an Alaises, it will not be stored UNLESS YOU add them into the .bashrc

Lets add Alias into files
- FIRST create a copy of the file 
	- cp .bashrc bashrc.bak
- sudo nano .bashrc.bak
	- go all the way to the pbolem 
		- #somemore ls alias 
			- Add under this comment 

$echo 'hello'
- create a text of hello 

$echo "alias whatdir='pwd' " >> .bashrc 
- not making a cmd but creating a .txt file
- if you mess with a existing cmd, it will replace it;
	- Ex: alias cd='rawr'
		- This will change cd to rawr cmd 
			- rawr is not a command so results in error 
- If you want to view your addition
	- tail .bashrc
- creating an echo will change 
	- because that is not the right file under user
- You will have to go to sysadmin 

NOTE: 
1. Make sure you are in the right Alias 
2. Make sure you make a back up

____
![[6.1.9.jpg]]
![[5.1.22.jpg]]
ls -a will show all hidden files 
![[5.1.23 1.jpg]]
- bashrc.bak 
	- Was created for a back up for '~/.bashrc'
		- Since corrupting this data will cause problems for other users 
- For cd /etc/
	- $alias etc='cd ~/etc/' >> ~/.bashrc.bak
- tail -4 ~/.bashrc.bak
	- To view the alias list

**My First Bash Script**
**Bash script:** An executable file that contains a series of commands
- When executed, commands will run one by one until they are all executed 

**Variables**
![[6.1.10.jpg]]
Ex of variables 
$var="hello"
- echo $var
	- result: hello
	- NOTE: you need to have $ to have the text repeat hello

NOTE: It will not replace the variable/ text
- You will need to use $VAR_NAME 

Create a variable 
VAR_NAME="VAR_CONTENT"

$nano my_script.sh
echo "This is my first script"
first_var="Message from var"
echo $first_var
echo "This is my $home"
- echo 
echo "the current time"
- echo "current time is ": date 
-end

$./myscript

____ 
![[6.1.13.jpg]]
USER
- echo $USER
	- "Current user"
- echo "my name is $USER"
	- "my name is *current user*"

Machine type
- echo $MACHTYPE
	- "x86_64 -pc -linux-gnu"
		- you can use this to see if it is not updated and what makes it vulnerable 
![[5.1.26.jpg]]
resulting: 
"This is my script, and today's date is _current date__"
"Tell you the current username"
"The ipaddress is _ipaddress_"
![[5.1.27.jpg]]
tells you the hostname
- vm0image0ubuntu-dev-1

**Custom Commands**
- Same thing as variables
- want Linux to run cmd 

echo $PATH
- /sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/user/local/bin:/snap/bin
	- Shows the path way to get to
