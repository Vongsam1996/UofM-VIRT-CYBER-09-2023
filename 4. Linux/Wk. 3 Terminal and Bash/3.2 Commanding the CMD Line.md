Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/03-student/day2/warmup/` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1. Make a directory in the `warmup` folder called `additional_evidence`.
mkdir `additional_evidence`

2. Navigate to the directory that contains the `physical_access_logs`.
cd `physical_access_logs` 

3. Using preview commands, identify the physical access logs that contain files for October 13, 2019. ( can use; more, less, head, tail )
$ Head physical1 
$ Head physical2
$ Head physical3 
$ Head physical4 - Oct 13 
$ Head physical5 - Oct 13 
$ Head physical6 


4. Combine these files into a single file called `Physical_Access_evidence`.
$ cat physical4 physical5 > Physical_Access_evidence
$ ls 
5. Move this new file over to the `additional_evidence` folder.
$ mv 

**Command Line Structure** 

**Method 1: Add an option to modify the command's default behavior** 
- Ex: command ls -S
	- ls : List
	- -S : by size, Largest first 
- Note: Options are CASE SENSITIVE
	- All options have different use for different command
		- ls -s : Print size of each file 
		- cat -s: suppress repeated empty output lines 

**Method 2: Add an option to modify the command's default behavior** 
- cat -n logfile1.txt : Display the line number 
	- cat: concatenates multiple files or displays the contents of a single file 
	- -n: adds display the line numbers preceding each line 

**Method 3: Add options that require their own arguments (Parameters)**
![[3.2.6.jpg]]

grep: search for filter for specified text
- cat fileE | grep Sheila
	-  | = filter

**Manual Pages (Linux)**
man (command)
- Show all options and modify
- Show description 

**Activity: Learning new commands** 
Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/03-student/day2/learning_new_commands/` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
cd `/03-student/day2/learning_new_commands/`
![[3.2.7.jpg]]

1. Within this directory are log files for each website. Within each log file is a list of IP addresses.
    - Each line represents an hour.
    - Each line includes the IP addresses connecting to the website during that hour.

    Using manpages, research how to use the `wc` command to count the total number of IP addresses in each file.
    
    **Hint:** There is more than one IP address on each line, so the line count command will not work.
$ head Chocolateyfun.com 
![[3.2.10.jpg]]
- Ip address were considered for words

$ man wc  (Looking for w count for Ip address)
![[3.2.8.jpg]]

$ wc -w Choco.... [all ip address]
![[3.2.9.jpg]]


2. Run the command to determine which website had the most network connections and was therefore the likely target of the attack.
- The highest number of the Ip address
	- wc -w * | sort
![[3.2.11.jpg]]
- PeanutButtery.net will be the targeted 

**Find** ****
**Find:** Command searches for files and directories with one command
- Will: Search through CURRENT and SUB- directories within that current directory 
- Will not: Does not review contents within a file, only the file name or directory name 

![[3.2.12.jpg]]
- -type f : meaning we are searching for files 

![[3.2.13.jpg]]
- -name: Exact match of files
	- Used less because only for the things you are looking for 

![[3.2.14.jpg]]

![[3.2.15.jpg]]
"* ":  Wild card - Meaning any symbols in the  '' will be found/ interacted with

**Solution Guide: Finding Your Way**
*The first step is to navigate into the /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/ folder on your virtual machine. To complete this, run the following command:*
- cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/


**The next step is to find all directories that have the word "secret" in their name. To do this, run:**
- find -type d -iname *secret*


Note the syntax:
- find: The command-line command.
- -type: The option for specifying whether you're searching for a file or a directory.
- d: The required parameter for the  -type option, indicating you're searching for a directory.
- -iname: The option indicating you're searching for a specific case-insensitive value.

*secret*: The parameter indicating the value you're searching for. The two wildcards indicate that the value secret can be located anywhere in the file name.

When you run the command, the results should return the following directory path containing the value of secret: ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes.
- This means the directory candysecretrecipes is within the disregard directory, within the other directory.

Next, we need to find the files that contain the word "recipe." The command to do this is:
- find -type f -iname *recipe*

Note the syntax:
- find: The command-line command.
- -type: The option for specifying whether you're searching for a file or a directory.
- f: The required parameter for the  -type option, indicating you're searching for a file.
- -iname: The option indicating you're searching for a specific case-insensitive value.
- *recipe*: The parameter specifying the value you're searching for. The two wildcards indicate that the value recipe can be located anywhere in the file name.

The results of the command should return the following four files that have the value of recipe in the name:
- ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_crunchybars
- ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutballs
- ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutsquares
- ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_yumbars

The four files are recipe_yumbars, recipe_peanutsquares, recipe_peanutballs, and recipe_crunchybars.Solution Guide: Finding Your Way

        - 
When you run the command, the results should return the following directory path containing the value of `secret`: `./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes`.
    
    - This means the directory `candysecretrecipes` is within the `disregard` directory, within the `other` directory.

Next, we need to find the files that contain the word "recipe." The command to do this is:
    
    - `find -type f -iname *recipe*
