**Firewalls**: Technical security control that distinguish between trusted and untrusted network traffic and network connections

**Notes about Network security** 
**Network Security** is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment

- Need to know log

Recap : Ports 
Network allows computers to communicate with one another by sending data to and from open ports on other machine 
- Devices must expose open ports in order to communicate with other machines on the network 
	- We can not assume that the only people who will connect to a device are those we trust 
	- malicious actors will exploit this assumption to access sensitive information 
	- Restricting access to open ports is a fundamental skill for any technical security specialist 

**Firewalls**
Firewalls provide a layer of protection by analyzing data leaving and entering a network 
- Place between application servers and routers to provide access control
- Protect trusted networks by isolating them from untrusted networks (like the internet)

![[11.1.1.jpg]]
- Firewalls can be used to either control access to a single host (**Host based firewall** or an entire network (**Network firewall**)
	- They both work the same way;
		- Intercept traffic before it reaches its target host or router 
		- Inspect the source and destination address and ports, TCP flags, and other feautres of the incoming pakets  
		- Allow packets that come from trusted sources and deny packet that dont

![[11.1.2.jpg]]
- Firewalls are multifunctional network security appliances that operate at multiple layers of the OSI model 
- They can be broken down 
	- Application gateway
	- Circuit-level gateway
	- Packet Filtering 
	- MAC

**MAC Layer Firewall - OSI Layer 2: Data link**
MAC firewall operate at layer 2 of the OSI and filter based on source and destination MAC addresses 
- Media access control (MAC) is an unique hardware ID that helps devices communicate with each other 
	- PRO: Secure network from novice attackers
	- CON: Easily bypassed by MAC spoofing 

**Packet-Filtering Firewalls (Stateless) - OSI layer 3 and 4: Transport and network** (Look at the source)
- Firewall statically evaluate the content of packets and do not keep track of the state of network connection (stateless)
- Verifies the three way tcp handshake
- Rules:
	- Source and Destination IP Address
	- Source and destination port information 
	- IP protocols 
	- Ingress and egress interface
		- PRO: Not resource intensive, meaning they are low-cost and do not have a significant impact on system performance
			- Work best with small network 
		- CON: Easy to subvert compared to more robust firewall
			- only operate at the network layer
			- They are vulnerable to spoofing and do not support custom based rule sets 

**Packet-Filtering Firewalls (Statelful) - OSI layer 3 and 4: Transport and network** (Looks at handshake)
- Stateful firewalls can determine if a packet is;
	- Trying to establish a new connection, known as a **new** state
	- Part of an exiting connection known as **established** state
	- Is neither a new nor an existing connection, known as a **rogue** packet 
Note :
- Rather than look at individual packets, stateful firewalls examine the connection as whole,  looking at streams of packet
- They inspect the packets’ conversation and routing tables and use a combination of TCP handshake verification and packet inspection technology
	- PRO: Offer transparent mode, which allows direct connections between clients and servers
	- CON: Are resource-intensive systems.
- NOTE X2: REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES

**Circuit-Level Firewalls** (looks at the )
TCP Handshake check can verify the following about a source
- Unique session identifier state of the connection (Handshake establish, close)
- Sequencing information 
NOTE: 
- These firewalls only look at the header of a packet
- Once the circuit is allowed to establish an end-to-end connection, all data is tunneled between parties.
	- PRO: Quickly and easily approve and deny traffic without consuming significant computing resources
	- CON: Do not check the contents of the packet
		- If a packet contains malware but has the correct TCP information, the data is allowed to pass through
NOTE X2: LOOK AT HEADERS

**Application proxy firewall - OSI layer 3 ->7**
They inspect the actual contents of the packet, including authentication and encryption components
- Proxy firewalls use deep packet inspection and stateful inspection to determine if incoming traffic is safe or harmful.
- They intercept all traffic on its way to its final destination, without the data source knowing
- A connection is established to the proxy firewall, which inspects the traffic and forwards it if it’s determined to be safe, or drops it if it’s determined to be malicious.
	- PRO: More secure than other implementations and provide simple log and file audit management for incoming traffic
	- CON: Resource intensive. Requires robust modern hardware and high costs. Bypassed with encryption.

**UFW**
**Uncomplicated firewall (UFW)**
- UFW is a multifunctional firewall that provides stateless and stateful packet filter
	- works on network address and port translation 
		- NAT Network address translation
		- NAP Network Address Protection

$sudo ufw reset 
- For practice, you want to have it off
- reset all rules
$sudo ufw status 
- List of all allowed and deny rules
$sudo ufw allow (port number)
- Allow ports
$ sudo ufw deny (port number)
- Deny ports
$sudo ufw delete deny (port number)
- undo deny port 

$sudo service firewalld stop
$sudo service firewalld status

ssh sysadmin@(sysadmin ip)
