**Active Directory**: Central Data basing and management system for enterprise-scale Windows environments
- NOTE: It is a program that allows you to control Operation system which is connected to multiple
- computers 

![[7.3.0.jpg]]
**Microsoft's Active Directory**: The system we use to manage these resources and security principals 
- Active Directory (AD): all services that works together to manage authentication and authorization within a windows server network 
	- Authentication: Allows users to prove their identity using a password, token, or biometric key
		- Personal accounts; who has access to their account 
		- Proof who they are 
	- Authorization: Provides or denies users permission to material 
		- Who has access to certain materials/ resources

**NOTE TO DO THE HOMEWORK**
GO TO HYPER-V MANAGER
- DOUBLE CLICK HYPER-V MANAGER 
	- CLICK ML -REFVM- 
		- right click and start 2 computers
- To connect
	- Right click -> Connect
		- Note: It will open another windows server
	- it should have sysadmin


**Objects**: The users, groups, and computers, and the file shares, network printers and other resources that user need to access 
![[7.3.1.jpg]]

AD Authentication protocols
**Lightweight directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: A standardized protocol for adding, deleting, and editing objects. 
- If active Directory is a journal of information, LDAP is the pencil and eraser
- Access with permission and protocol

**Kerberos:** A ticket-based authentication protocol, now the default authentication protocol for Windows Server domain
- It provides direct encrypted session between users and networked resources 

**New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)**: An authentication protocol that has become outdated because of pass the hash attacks 


![[7.3.2.jpg]]
1. You sign in, you get a ticket and it will tell other servers who you are 
	1. This will tell central services that you are either valid or not to access your email/ account/ resources

Make sure you are windows server -> Unlink from No control panel -> Right click it and unlink

Make sure that you have the **Windows Server machine** launched before going forward.

âš  Unlink the **No Control Panel** GPO before covering the review.

1. Navigate to the `Group Policy Management` tool.
    
    - With the `Server Manager` open, click on `Tools` at the top-right.
        
    - Select the `Group Policy Management` tool.
        
2. Name the GPO `Limit Settings`.
    
    - In the `Group Policy Management` window, right-click `Group Policy Objects` under `GOODCORP.NET` and click `New`.
        
    - In the `New GPO` window, type in `Limit Settings` for the `Name:`.
        
    - Click `OK`.
        
    - The `Limit Settings` will show up under `Group Policy Objects` now.
        
3. Right-click the GPO to `Edit...` its policies.
    
    - Find the policy you need under `User Configuration` > `Policies` > `Administrative Templates` > `Control Panel`. The policy you're looking for is called `Settings Page Visibility`. This policy is **not** in a subfolder in `Control Panel`.
        
    - Set the policy to `Enabled`.
        
    - Under `Settings Page Visibility:`, enter `showonly:about;themes`.
        
    - Apply and accept these changes.
        
    - Close the `Group Policy Management Editor` window.
        
4. After you have enabled the policy, link the GPO to the `Sales` OU.
    
    - Right-click the `Sales` OU, select `Link an Existing GPO...`.
        
    - In the `Select GPO` window, select the `Limit Settings` GPO we just made and click `OK`.
        
5. Add the Sales group to the Remote Desktop Users group like shown earlier, if you haven't already.
    
    - Open the `Active Directory Users and Computers` menu.
        
    - Expand your `GC Users` Organizational Unit.
        
    - Select the `Sales` sub-Organizational Unit. The `Sales` _group_ will appear in the right-hand pane.
        
    - Right-click that `Sales` group and select `Add to a group...`.
        
    - Under the `Enter the object names to select` area, enter `Remote` and click `Check Names`.
        
    - Click the `Remote Desktop Users` and click `OK`.
        
    - Click `OK` again.
        
6. Refresh these policy and group changes on the Windows 10 machine.
    
    - Go back to the Windows 10 machine, open a `CMD` or `PowerShell` window and enter:
        
        - `gpupdate`
    - This will update the Windows 10 machine with your latest changes.
        
    - Take a quick moment to look at the default `Windows Settings`.
        
        - Click the `Start` menu. Then click the cogwheel icon to launch the `Settings` menu.
            
        - You don't have to do anything here, but notice the different settings your `sysadmin` account has access to.
            
7. Test the Group Policy changes as `Bob`. Verify that Bob's account has limited access to `Windows Settings` by doing the following:
    
    - Log into the **Windows 10 machine** as the local `sysadmin` account and run `gpupdate` to pull the latest updates.
        
    - Toggle **Enhanced Session Mode** _OFF_ then log into the **Windows 10 machine** as `Bob` with password `Ilovesales!`.
        
    - Once you're back in the **Windows 10 machine**, click the `Windows` button in the bottom-left and then click the `Settings` icon.
        
        - If you created the GPO properly, we should only see two entries there: `System` and `Personalization`.
            
        - This indicates that the Group Policy Object was successfully applied. The standard `Windows Settings` screen has many more options.
            
    - Know that system administrators will often restrict access to various operating system settings to prevent users from making irreversible or potentially dangerous changes to their system.
        
8. Authenticate back to our local `sysadmin` account:
    
    - Log out of Bob's account by toggling **Enhanced Session Mode** _ON_ again.
        
    - Back at the Windows lock screen, click the screen and select `Other user`.
        
    - For the username, enter `.\sysadmin` and `cybersecurity` for the password. You'll notice that the `Sign in to:` selection at the bottom automatically changes when you type `.\`.
        

By toggling the session mode, you can use `GoodCorp.net\Bob` to sign into Bob's domain account, and `.\sysadmin` to sign into the local `sysadmin` account.
