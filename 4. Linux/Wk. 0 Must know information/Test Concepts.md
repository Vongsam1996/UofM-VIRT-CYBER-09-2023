***CIA TRAIDS*** 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*****CIA Triad: 3 cornerstones of information security ***

1. Confidentiality (Non-public information)
	1. Example: Hacked customer’s information would make the company look unreliable
	2. State of being kept secret or private 
3. Integrity (untempted information)
	1. Protecting information from being modified or tampered by unauthorized person 
	2. Having strong morals 
	3. Hacking their information and turning it usable (encrypted their files) 
	4. Steal employer’s assets 
	5. The quality of being honest, whole or undivided
	6. Venmo sending money - Sending 100 and received 100
3. Availability (access to data) 
    1. Ensuring that all operating system, equipment, and data are functioning correctly and accessible by those who need it 
    2. The easy access to companies would still be welcome even if they were hacked - Amazon, twitter, etc. 
    3. If companies that are not working properly then customers can not go there and slowly stop 
    4. Quality of being able to be used or obtained**


**Activity 1: Security Culture framework - part 1 
--
"Employees have been observed holding the door open for others behind them when accessing the building, without each employee scanning their own individual badge.  

The organization has determined that this behavior has led to several non-employees gaining unauthorized and undocumented access to several offices. With over 500 current employees, you can imagine how this might introduce serious issues.

Crucially, the Incident Response team recently identified that an attacker was able to steal confidential financial data from the servers in the Finance department. These machines are not connected to the internet, so the breach must have resulted from physical access to the Finance machines."

Problem: Employees have been observed hold ing the door open for others behind them when accessing the build 

How: 
- Measure how many people come in without badges (tailgating)
- Motion sensors cameras (face ids)
- Signed in employees (badged/ scheduled)
- Key access pad ( see unique people entered legally)
- mantraps     
- Turn style    
- Visitors logs    
- Security guard    
- Retina scans? Chip implants? 
- Training 

Risk 
- Unauthorized attackers that can access your computer/servers 
- Theft 
- Physical damages
- Employee personal belonging
- Physical safety

Goal: 
- 5 - 10%
Timeline 
- 90 days**

**What a company do 
Step 1: 
Security culture (SCF) team meet to assess the impact of the phishing incident and the risk posed by future campaign 
- Discussion;
- Assessment of the damage done by the previous phishing incident 
- Using pentesting phishing attacks to show many many employees download malicious files 
-  Setting target    

Step 2 
SCF team manager meets with CISO to explain previous phishing attack because ____

Step 3
Develop team develop training plan 
- Awareness training plan
- Delivered to employees who continue to click malicious links after training 

Step 4
SCP team decides on incentives and disincentive 
- Incentives: 40$ gift card, free or discounted security conference attendance, and additional vacation time 
- Disincentive: Supplemental security awareness training and additional random device audits for one quarter

Step 5
SCF team collaborates with HR to determine the best dates to run training 
- HR team explains that the most reliable way to ensure 100% attendance over the next fiscal year is to have quarterly training session training 25% of employees each time
- SCF and HR coordinator the specific dates and location of the training 

Step 6
SCF team collaborates with communication to develop and distribute information about the training 

Step 7
SCF Team sets up and implements the training as scheduled**

Step 8
SCF team contracts the same pretesting firm to run the phishing campaign against all employees who have already been trained 
- Test is expensive

Step 9
Every test, the SCF team identifies employees who still clicked malicious links, and requires them to go through supplemental security awareness training 

Step 10 
SCF team ruins a final phishing campaign to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the training**

Activity 2: Security Culture framework - part 2 
---
1.Make an Action Plan: Identify your "plan of attack." For example, you might propose to implement training, implement stricter security controls, or some combination of the two.
- Training, communicating with everyone

2.Schedule: Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: Explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.
- 90 days - 1 year to train everyone 
- Q1 25%   

3.Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs): Explain what you will measure to determine if your plan has been successful. Specify KPIs indicating what you want your plan to achieve. These are your planned goals.
- 0 - 5%  

4.Measurements: Explain how you will measure the success of your plan. Specify both when and how you'll measure results.
- Recreating recurring training like target


Activity part 3: Security Control

Mantraps - Physical control 
- Restrict access 
employees/ customers  - Send out policy and allow them a trainer and knowledge what they are requesting before they can access the building 
- Punishment: 1 time warning, 2nd time restrict access and training, 3rd time write up, and after 3 times then terminated

Jail fencing - Restricting from different countries/ location
