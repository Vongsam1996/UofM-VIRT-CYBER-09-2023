**Digital Forensic**: The process of using scientific procedures to collect, analyze, and present evidence from digital devices, usually in relation to criminal investigations 

![[20.1.0.jpg]]

Importance of preserver the integrity of digital evidence
- Forensic evidence intended to be used in legal proceedings must satisfy a set of legal standards to be admissible
- To avoid losing months of work searching through computer and network systems and collecting evidence, only to have it considered inadmissible and thrown out due to improper procedures
- Forensic evidence is held to the same standards as any other evidence submitted in a legal case. All evidence must be wholly intact and unaltered from the scene of the crime

**Digital Forensics and the Chain of Custody**
Goal of digital forensics is to prevent evidence that can be used in a court of law
- **Chain of custody**: documentation of possession of evidence that proves integrity and accountability of the investigation by;
	- Documenting every steps of investigation
	- showing uninterrupted controls 
	- ensuring evidence is not tampered with our contaminated 

Digital Forensic Process 
![[20.1.1.jpg]]
**Collection:**
- Collect data before we can examine and analyze it;
	- The collection phase is the springboard to the digital forensics process. It includes identifying, labeling, recording, and acquiring data from sources while following procedures to preserve the integrity of the data

**Examination:**
- The examination phase ensures that all data collected is relevant to the case;
	- This includes forensically processing collected data and assessing and extracting data of interest while preserving the integrity of the data. This usually means working from a copy, not the original

**Analysis**
- The analysis phase analyzes the results of the examination;
	- Analysis uses legally approved methods and techniques to derive information that addresses the questions that inspired the collection and examination of the data

**Reporting**
- Investigators are required to formally report results of the analysis;
	- This may include describing the actions used, explaining how tools and procedures were selected, determining what other actions need to be performed, and recommending improvements to the forensic process

**Evidence Collection**
two types of classification; 

**Network-based data**
Comes from data communications captured by network-based systems such as IDS, IPS, and firewalls, in the form of a packet capture or similar.
- Packet captures are useful for reconstructing events involving computer break-ins.
- Logs from firewalls also provide insight into network activity.

**Host-based Data**
Typically found on a system that has a wide variety of artifacts.
- Investigations involving computer break-ins may involve the forensic examination of local file systems, programs, access to critical documents, and/or alterations to system files and directories
 - Host-based examinations may involve reconstructing internet use, unauthorized activity, email recovery, and the identification of malicious files.

**Creating Forensic Backup**
![[20.1.2.jpg]]
**Bit-stream image:** captures all created sections of a hard drive (partitions), whether used or not, and all unallocated drive space that does not belong to partitions 
- This method allows forensic examiner to recover deleted files and fragments of data that may exist on the hard drive 

![[20.1.3.jpg]]
**Local file system copy:** Inadequate for forensic analysis. If you make a copy through the file or operating system level, you can access only the data that the operating system can access
- note this wont capture deleted files or slack space

**Bit-level copy:** Captured deleted file or slack space

___
**Forensic Disk Image Format**
![[20.1.4 1.jpg]]
- Forensic backup images are created in the following format above 

Forensic backups (system image or bit-stream image) create an exact replica of all contents on the hard drive, including slack space, free space, and deleted files

**File system**

___
**Firmware**
Firmware: Specific class of computer software that provides the low-level control for a device's specific hardware 

**Working with cloud -based Evidence**
- Working with online evidence such as hard drives and volatile memory located on cloud-based hardware present a whole new set of challenges
	
____
Activity: Digital Forensic in the cloud 
Difficulty;
- Finding the data - It could be a different locations 
- Every cloud provider is different
- malicious user can claim that everyone in the world with internet access should be a suspect 
- difficult to pin point where the victim's data ends and where data belong

___
**Digital Forensic Types**
- Computer Forensic, disk forensics, memory forensics, network forensics, email forensics, mobile device forensics 
	- Digital forensics is a continuously evolving scientific field that incorporates many subdisciplines 

**Computer forensics:** the identification, preservation, collection, analysis, and reporting of evidence acquired from computers, notebooks, and storage media
- It is used to support investigations and legal proceedings 

![[20.1.8 1.jpg]]
- computer forensics subtopics include

___
**Network Forensics**
Network Forensics: the monitoring, recording, storing, and analysis of  
all network traffic to determine the source of security events
- programs: Wireshark, networkMiner, and Snort
	- Investigators in this area must have an excellent understanding of communication and network protocols, and the tools needed to capture and analyze data 

___
**Email forensics**
email forensics: analyzes the source and content of an email as evidence 
- Email forensics includes the process of identifying the sender, recipient, date, time, and original location of an email 
	- IE;
	- ![[20.1.9 1.jpg]]
	- ![[20.1.10 1.jpg]]

____
**Mobile Device forensics:** the recovery of digital evidence from smartphones, GPS devices, SIM cards, PDAs, tablets, and game consoles 
- IE;
	- cell phone forensics might be used in a distracted driving case
	- Forensic expert could analyze what was happening at the time of the accident 

____
**Methodology for Conducting an Investigation**
**Investigation Methodology-**
![[20.1.11 1.jpg]]
- National Institute of standards and Technology provide one of many frameworks for forensic investigation phases

**Collection**
The success of the investigation relies on the collection phase
- During this phase, an investigator makes decisions about what data to collect  
    and the best way to collect it.
- Evidence is extracted from a device and a master copy is made.
- How you collect the evidence determines whether it will be admissible in court

**Preserving Evidence**
Investigators never work with the original copy of evidence
- Instead, a read-only master copy is made and stored in a digital vault. All processes are  
    worked on the copy
- A cryptographic digest is made to ensure that evidence has not been altered in any way

**Analysis**
Analysis is completed after data is collected
- This process is also known as dead analysis
- Investigators document everything, including time, dates, applications used, etc.
- If evidence cannot be reproduced, it may be ruled as inadmissible in court

**Reporting**
Investigators write an expert report that explains:
- What tests were conducted.
- When, how, and what was found.
- The conclusions of the investigation.
Digital forensics analysts may testify as expert witnesses in a trial or deposition

- Importance - We will see their text message and see why they are divorce.
	- There is a corrupt cop - 
	- Alex is related to Tracy through carry 

Tracy is trying to scam on two points 

Alex and Carry are trying to eface the national Galleryy DC 
- Motivation: Shame the US 
- Flash Mob guy - How they got in touch with Carry
- Alex has the money and sending the money to Tracy 
	- Tracy needs to pay for their child private school 
	- Carry gets the information from Alex and send it to Tracy 

key logger -> It is llegal?
- husband bought it for his wife's mac book 
	- Thought she was cheating but discover something else 
- It is illegal until the crime happened
	- illegal to spy on people 
		- Note: If we have it, we have more evidence that is not tie to the keylogger 
			- If it does, then weaken the case 
	- Legal -> Federal level dangers
		- Tracy is a Federal employee 
			- this is a Federal Danger so the Key logger is Legal 

Pat is the brother of Tracy
- He has a different motive
- He wants to make money and try to get money for Tracy 
- King ask to steal -> Pat -> Get money for Tracy 

List of Evidence 
We do not have Tracy's mac book which has the key logging
