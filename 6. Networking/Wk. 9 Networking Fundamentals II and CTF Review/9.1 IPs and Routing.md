Recap : 
![[9.1.0.jpg]]
Note: private IP address does not talk 
- It will make a packets -> Source Private IP Address, Here is the port, and send it to the  google
	- The packets will go to the server and will send that message to google 
		- It will tell google to use this port when they SYN/AWK 


____
Review; 
Private IP Addresses: Are used for device within a Local Area Network (LAN)
- Your phone can have its own Private IP Address
	- Three different type of Private IP Address
		- Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		- Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		- Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

**DHCP and NAT**
**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** client-server based protocol on your local network that is responsible for managing and assigning IP address 
	- DHCP is dynamic because device does not have fixed IP addresses 
- DHCP client: Any device that needs a dynamic IP address (EX: your computer
	- EX: of Best buy computer connecting to the internet for the first time 
- DHCP Server: Provider of the IP addresses on your local network 

In Linux 
$ip route 

ipconfig /all 
- Where is the router 
	- Reason why -> So it can take the shortest path

Note: 
- Small or home network, the DHCP server is typically located on your router
- Enterprise level could be on its own server 

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is layer 7: application layer protocol
- Uses two UDP ports;
	- Port 67 used by the server
	- Port 68 used by client 

![[9.1.1.jpg]]
**DHCP Discover**
Needs to find the right server

**DHCP Offer**
Server finds that right server with available IPs and sends it out to networks

**DHCP Request** (Request should come before the offer)
Client sends a message back to the DHCP server 

**DHCP ACk**
Server feels the client the IP is valid for a perido of time called DGCP LEase 
- Once expires the DHCP servers can give the IP to another device 

___
**Instructor Demo: DHCP**
We are going to Downloads DHCPactivity.capng and open throuh wire shark 

note: Destination sent too 255.255.255.255 
- Meaning it was sent to everyone
- Looking at the time 
	- year/date/ time are exactly the same or close to each other
		- This is SHOW that there is a problem 
![[9.1.14.jpg]]
Bottom left; Dynamic host -> Option 1 or 2 

DHCP Discover
![[9.1.16.jpg]]
type dhcp.option.dhcp == 1
- This will find all DHCP discover
	- The computer that needs the IP Address
		- Discovering the server
- Workstation 1 asking for Temporary IP Address 

DHCP Offer
![[9.1.15.jpg]]
type dhcp.option.dhcp == 2
- DHCP offer can be 
- This shows all the response. whom DHCP accepts/ deny these request 
- Work station 2: Responds 
The person who responded to the offer -> 10.0.2.2 (Source)

dhcp.option.dhcp == 3
- Find DHCP Request
- NOTE: This example does not have any request

2. 
Analysis; dhcp.option.dhcp == 1
- Denial of service - because multiple discover 
	- Overload the server which does not allow real customers to sign in because there are too many request


NOTE: Public IP Address will only be the Router (Gateway)
- Most information will gather from their Private IP Address 
- Public IP Address is asking for a service to get a Private IP address for your computer 
	- Ex:
		- Workstation asking for IP address -> Router ask for Private IP Address -> Workstation 2 SYN: sends that back to server AWK: give them this IP Address-> Inform to server -> Workstation  
			- 

Think DHCP is a service 
- It kind of signing into a wifi 

DHCP -> Give you identifications 
- They will give you a temporary IP Address
	- When you enter the network, you become a client 
	- It does services work
		- Let you gain access to the internet and websites 
____
**Network Address Translation (NAT)**
**Network Address Translation (NAT):** Method of mapping a private IP Address to a public IP address and vice versa 
- This will tell you how to get to the internet 

 Focus in Layer 3: Network 
 - Mapping get sorted in a network address translation table 
- Router considered the **gateway** between Private and public network 
- Traffic needing to go from private -> public network and public -> Private needs to go through the **gateway**
	- Or even Private -> private networks 

Scenario of NAT step by step: 
![[9.1.2.jpg]]
Private IP is your computer trying to access google which is Public IP 
Your network Public IP address is the router 

**Step 1**: Create the Packet
![[9.1.3.jpg]]
- Computer creates a packet with this info
- port: 80 -> Internet 
- Port: 49200 -> Go to this port to collect information 

**Step 2**: Packet to NAT Table 
![[9.1.4.jpg]]
- packet is sent to the internal router which creates a record in the NAT table 
	- Client's *Source IP and Ports* -> Router's *LAN Address* 
	- Client has it's own *Destination IP and Port* private IP
	- NAT table creates WAN Address



**Step 3** Going Public
![[9.1.5.jpg]]
- The router modifies the packet and replaces the source IP with the network's IP address 
	- Router's *Lan Address* is neutral 
	- Router's *WAN Address* -> Public IP *Source IP and Port*
	- Public has it's own *Destination IP and Port* IP Address

Destination IP  and port -> Where you want to go 
Destination IP and Port  -> Location 
- NOte, NAT table/ router put their public address to Public 

NOTE: 
- Asking if it can connect to server
	- Private Server information: Destination IP and Port (Data/ Credentials they want to transfer)
	- Pathing;
		- Private Source IP and Port -> server's Lan Address
		- Server's Convert Lan Address -> WAN Address 
		- Server's WAN Address -> Public/ server's Source IP 
		- Public/server reads and accepts this data 

**Step 4**: Source Receives and Responds 
![[9.1.6.jpg]]
- When Google.com receives the packet, it creates a response packet 
	- Note:
		- Public Source IP and port = Responding packet IP Address

**Step 5:** Back to NAT
![[9.1.7.jpg]]
- When the router receives that packet, it checks the NAT table to see exactly which device is expecting this packet 
	- Responding path: 
		- Note: Data of Source IP and Port is being transfer 
		- Public/ Responding Packet is sending data Destination IP and Port -> WAN Address 
		- Server convert WAN Address -> Lan Address 
		- Server sends Lan Address -> Private Destination IP and Port
		- Private accepts the Source IP and Ports
- Note This is spending the packet back to rely that the server accepts access to their website/ account
- Note: The router gave you the information that Google is communicating to you 

**Step 6: Return of Packet**
![[9.1.8.jpg]]
- Your Device with private Destination Ip and Port receives that packet and you can now view google/ website/ account 

___
**DHCP Attacks**
**DHCP server** have limited number of IP addresses that they can distribute to device on a LAN 
- If attackers access LAN, they can send large number of DGCP message over the network requesting IP addresses from the DHCP servers 
- Excess requesting IP address, DHCP servers may run out of IP Addresses to distribute 
- DHCP server runs out of IPs, new, legitimate users wont be able to receive a private address 

![[9.1.9.jpg]]
- Deny of service 
It is a DHCP Starvation when you see a bunch of discover 
- See a lot of request from the same destination 

___
**Instructor Demo: Visualizing DHCP Starvation**



Notes: Prevent DHCP starvation is to set a maximum threshold 
- Threshold is the number of DHCP request a server can accept per second 
	- Go to WireShark (dhcp.option.dhcp == 1)
		- Request every two seconds / create a alert 
___
**DHCP Spoofing**
After the DHCP Starvation attack occurs, an attackers can potentially set up a fraudulent DHCP server 
- Fraudulent DHCP server can falsely send out spoof messages to the DHCP clients, identifying a malicious router that clients should direct traffic to 
	- Once DHCP clients make this change, they will start sending out their traffic to the malicious router 
	- Attacker can then use the router to capture sensitive data

**Routing Schemes and Protocols** (slide 44)
**Routes**
Data takes a route from source to destination
**Routing**: Act of choosing the path that traffic takes in or across networks 

**Routing Schemes**
- **Unicast:** A Single device delivers a message a another single specific device 
	- A phone call between two people
	- Disadvantage; 
		- Message has to reach multiple destination, many unicast message must be sent 
- **Broadcast:** A single Device broadcasts a message to all device on that same network
	- DHCP offer message that is broadcast across an entire LAN
		- Disadvantage:
			- Broadcast messages are sent to everyone on a network, they can cause unnecessary traffic 
- **Multicast**: A device sends a message to device that have expressed interest in receiving the message 
	- A subscription-based service sends network traffic to its subscribers 
	- Disadvantage 
		- Intended recipients will need to be updated and maintained to make sure they're accurate 

**Routing Techniques**
Networks need to select an optimal route to make sure network traffic is delivered efficiently
- Networks use two primary routing techniques to determine the path for transmitting their network traffic
	1. Static Routing
	2. Dynamic Routing 

**Static routing**
Static routing: Manual configuration of a network route, typically done by a network administrator
- Advantage: Lower CPU on router, network administrator has full control of their network's routing behavior 
- Disadvantages: Fault tolerance, meaning fi a device on a manually created path fails, the route can't be adjusted 

**Dynamic Routing**
Dynamic Routing: Solves the fault tolerance issue by allowing the network to act on tis own to avoid network blockages 
- Advantage;
	- Network is adaptive and data gets forwarded on a different route depending on the network condition
	- it is the primary routing technique used over the internet 
	- Uses Routing protocols to determine the best route to direct the traffic 

**Routing Protocols**
Two primary criteria's to determine optimal path 

**Distance** 
Distance: The amount of devices or hops used to get the data from the source to the destination 
- 10 vs 7 hops
	- Routing Protocol will choose with 7 hops 

**Distance-Vector Routing Protocols**: Dynamic routing protocol that yse distance as criteria 
- ![[9.1.17.jpg]]

**Speed**
Speed: The route is determined by the time it takes to move from source to destination
- ex: Route has more Hops does not mean it is always slower
	- Path with more hops might be faster if there's network congestion on the path with fewer hops 
	- Explanation:
		- Hops should not be thought as Traffic but more of picking a grocery line 
			- See which hop (Cashier) is faster 
			- How much traffic/ items in each line 
			- How many request (customers) are in the line 

**Routing Protocols: OSPF**
**Opening Shortest path First (OSPF)**: One link State routing Protocol 
![[9.1..18.jpg]]
Ex: A -> C 

**Distance -vector routing protocol**: 
- A > C = one hop 

**Opening shortest path first (OSPF)**
- A > B > C = 6 hops
- A > C = 8 hops 
OSPF will pick 1st option

**WiFi**
WiFi: Wireless technology that use radio waves to provide wireless internet and network connections 

**Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Networking hardware device that connects a wireless network to a wired network 
- WAPs broadcast a signal called **Beacon** that computer detect and tune into 
- Select "View Available Wireless Network" -> These are detecting beacon signals 
- **Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)**: Identify its MAC address in a beacon signal 

wigle.net 
- CAn look at access points anywhere
	- They are pulic information (Blue dots)

You can broadcast you network WIFI and hide you SSID 
- Security: 
	- Open -> No password
	- WEP -> Can be crack
	- WPA personal-> Good 
- 2.4 Ghz 5Ghz
	- Iphones lieks to jump between

- SSID -> That WiFi User 
- Anything broadcast -> Is public information 
![[9.1.30.jpg]]
- To access to see all the statictics of all information -> Wireless -> WLAN Traffic 
- Do not want Channels to over lap -> They pick numbers that are not next to each other 
	- Skip numbers/ some other numbers 
- Packets tells you how busy -> Most talktive clients 
- Other protection 
	- WEP - Very vulnerable 
- You can foucs on other SSID by right clicking and click filter 
	- It will give you the display filter on top
