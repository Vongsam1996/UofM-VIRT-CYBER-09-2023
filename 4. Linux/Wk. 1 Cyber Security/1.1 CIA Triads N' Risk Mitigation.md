***CIA TRAIDS*** 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*****CIA Triad: 3 cornerstones of information security ***

***1. ***Confidentiality (Non-public information)**
	1. Example: Hacked customer’s information would make the company look unreliable
	2. State of being kept secret or private 
***3.*** ***Integrity (untempted information)***
	1. Protecting information from being modified or tampered by unauthorized person 
	2. Having strong morals 
	3. Hacking their information and turning it usable (encrypted their files) 
	4. Steal employer’s assets 
	5. The quality of being honest, whole or undivided
	6. Venmo sending money - Sending 100 and received 100
***3. Availability (access to data)*** 
    1. Ensuring that all operating system, equipment, and data are functioning correctly and accessible by those who need it 
    2. The easy access to companies would still be welcome even if they were hacked - Amazon, twitter, etc. 
    3. If companies that are not working properly then customers can not go there and slowly stop 
    4. Quality of being able to be used or obtained


***Reflection: We described cybersecurity as centering on two concepts***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk Mitigation and threat assessment 
- Do not eliminate risk 

How to assess risk and handle does risk ?
***Threat assessment:*** Process of identifying the threats posed to a group or system 
- What could happen

***Risk Mitigation:*** Systematic reduction of impact and/or likely occurrence of a negative effect
- How can we handle them
- What are you going to do about the threats 
- Tesla - Cameras and Video

Framework- CIA Triad
Provide an example of how each of the three 

1. Confidentiality
	1. Data Breach 
2. Integrity
	1. Leaking personal information 
	1. Giving money to yourself (banking industry
3. Availability 
	3. Corruption data 
	4. Network down
    

Security Task # 1 

Activity - Two students left their phones unattended 

- What is the worst possible damage that could happen?
    
- Thinking about real damage
    
- Think beyond the value of the phone itself 
    

  

Access to their personal information like password, Banking account number, to email accounts, gain access to their contacts and asking for money. Sign up for EDD with your SSI that was collected on your phone 

  

Wipe phone and resold it  
Black mail photos and sensitive material

Credential for emails and social media accounts

Install application are used to make purchase

Malware software is directly installed to track future activity

Phone contacts are socially engineered to provide money

Phone conduct illegal activity

***Activity: Security Task P.2 ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Consider various strategies that attackers can use to penetrate an insecure login***

Pen testing - Penetration test 
You and your team have just been hired by a very successful start up that runs a Bitcon dating exchange. They handed you a lot of money to solve their most critical problem. Their login process is totally insecure. Attackers are routinely logging in as users (and Administrator) and gaining access to company data and financial assets. We will play the role of defender. In groups, develop a list of 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and login as an user or administrator 

Who (or what) is the initial target?
- Owner of the company 
- The Data 
- The customer/ Wallets regarding to bitcoin
- Mine bitcoin on their machine 

How would the actor implement the attack 
- Sell their date back and sell it to others in the dark web

Note: Users and Admins -> Web login -> Server -> Data -> Server - Web Login.
- Want to protect the Data the most Can always rebuild servers and Web login 
    
1. Phishing emails
2. P-logging: keylogger programing 
3. Wifi network hacking/ Fake wifi hacking 
4. Login as an administration
5. USB (physical attack)
6. Personal information
7. Stealing location information
8. Backdoor
9. Malware attacks 
10. Drive by attack - Malware on banner and advertisements 
11.  Denial of services: DOS 
12. Command control 
13. SQL ejection  
14. Credential-based attack
15. C^2
16. Trojan horse attack 
17. DDoS: Attack the website; Flood the website with accounts 

Watering hole attacks
- Animals will come and drink water than leave 
- Cyber security, someone is drinking water in the website and show a pop up 
- A Way to infect visitors in 
- User need to interact

Drive- by 
- Anyone who visit a link will infect the computer 
- User need to interact

***Type of Hacking***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHALING Phishing: Going after the bigger organization and not the smaller person. 

Spear Phishing: Target a department in the company regardless of their positions 

Smishing: Message with a link 
- Your packaging is ready, click this link

Vishing: Voice 
- Telling people that you work as IT in person to gain physical access

Cloning Phishing: Sending exactly the same email. 

Credential reuse: Attacker can find users’ login and password information on other website

Malware: An attacker can deploy malware (Keyloggers)

Man in the middle attack: Free WiFi hotspot to capture user credentials

Sniff packet: Attacker can sniff packet traffic across insecure wireless networks such as a cafe or restaurant 

Stolen Hardware: Attacker can simply steal a computer and use the saved credential to login 
- Encrypt your data

Brute force attack: An attacker can use a brute force attack to continuously attempt username and -password combinations 

Code injection: i An attack can exploit faulty session management, when developers incorrectly implement code used to maintain login and logout 

OS exploit: Server, which run on an operating attack (os) 
- SHODAN - Search engine:
- Webcam search bar (Camera can be access)
- Can see what is online
- Windows
- Can find your website

default credential: Database management system often come with default credential, which might be left unchanged 
- Can find the model cameras 
- Type in Github - Seclist: can see passwords, payload (virus), usernames, etc 
- Default credentials 

Lack of segregation: Database might allow a client to look at another client’s data

Activity 3 
-----------------------------------
***Security task 3: Defending the wall*** 
Mitigation plans 
Web attack (Brute force attacks, Code Injection, Faulty Session)
- Ensure strong passwords
- Sanitize any input in the web application form fields and filter the output

Server attacks (OS exploits, Malicious software)
- Ensure users are immediately logged out when closing a browser 
- Ensure all servers are routinely patched against latest known vulnerability 
- Incorporate antivirus and user education 

Note: KnowBe4 - Awareness program (Automated security) 
- Movies and Tv shows (expensive)
