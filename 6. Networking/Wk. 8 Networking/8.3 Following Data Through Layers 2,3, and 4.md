**Introduction to Enumeration**
**Enumeration:** Process of gathering data for a specific network, usually for the purpose of finding ways to gain access into that network
- Note: NUMERATION is like POKING -> To see where can we access 
- What information does Enumeration provide?
	- Physical Addresses of device within a network
	- IPs and ports that are being used or the accessible
	- Network and network security device bein used 

Under the OSI Model -> Security professional use protocol and tools that exist in Layer 2 - 4 
![[8.3.0.jpg]]
TCP - Power Protocol or most communication
- Under TCP - Run Email/etc
UDP - Not as popular
- Not important information

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - Layer 2: data link** 
Recap process used by networks to communicate with each other over the internet:
- Wide area network: Devices communicate through multiple networks
- Local Area Network: Data travels across internet to destination network 
	- Data reaches LAN -> WAN -> WAN if they want to communicate with other LAN 
	- ![[8.3.1.jpg]]
		- Once on LAN, Data is routed through network devices called switches to a physicals machine address
			- Media access control (MAC) address also known as Physical address
				- Without MAC address, data may reach the LAN but does not know where to transmit the data 
				- MAC Address is usually found on a switch 

____
**Layer 2: Data Link**
![[8.3.2.jpg]]
- To ensure data gets from the LAN to the machine, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps the MAC address to an IP address within the LAN 
	- Explanation:
		- This is showing the Model of Data link 
		- Below will show the response step by step 
		- Switch will keep the record of access to certain IP Address 

**Step 1:**
![[8.3.3.jpg]]
- Network device transmitting data broadcast an ARP request to all device in its network to find the physicals address matching the IP Address 
	- Explanation: 
		- Work Station (as a client) is looking for the IP address above  
		- Switch (server) identify and execute the request from the client 

Note: Brand new computer plugged into a server 
- Broadcast to everyone in the switch that I need an MAC Address 
- Why Use MAC Address instead of IP Address
	- MAC Address can not change
	- IP Address can change


**Step 2:**
![[8.3.4.jpg]]
- Device that owns that IP address recognizes its IP in the ARP request
	- It sends an ARP reply within its MAC address so the network knows where to route the data 
	- Explanation: 
		- Switch (client) request IP address request from private work station 
		- Top work station (server) identify and accepts request from work station 1 and reply request back to switch which sends data to the previous request
		- Bottom work station identify and decline request from work station 1 and does not reply 


**Step 3**
![[8.3.5.jpg]]
- **ARP cache**: Mapping MAC address to IP Address 
	- Next time, Work Station does not need to broadcast an ARP request since the network has automatically record that information in its cache
	- Explanation: 
		- When work station needs to connect the IP address, It will know where to go because it is save in the cache 
			- This will lower the time to connecting or interacting with top work Station. 

**Dynamic ARP entries**: Entries added to the ARP cache
- Meaning: Can be changed with future ARP replies 

**ARP Cache timeout**: Dynamic ARP entries will only stay in ARP cache for a limited period of time 
- When ARP cache timeout expires; it is removed from ARP and any future request for host requires a new request 
	- Ex: Chase account
		- When you sign into the account, you can stay for a period amount of time 
			- Dynamic ARP Cache is created
		- After a certain amount inactivity will automatic log you out
		- Then you must sign into the account again 
			- Dynamic ARP cache is removed 
>arp -a 
- Tells you Dynamic - Sent automatic 
____
**Instructor Demo: ARP and Wireshark Setup**
Goals:
- Filter for all ARP packets in .pcap file 
- Filter will show; request from source host;
	- Mac address, associated with specific IP address, that data needs to be transmitted to
- Request can be successfully answered; 
	- Response from owner of the IP address that contains the device MAC address 

Install Wireshark
![[8.3.32.jpg]]
![[8.3.33.jpg]]
- Destination - Will tell you who is asking for what 
To change your time -> view -> Time display Format 
Name reolution -> REsolve Physical Address
- If Dell computer-> Will tell what is the computer 
- Network Address -> Website name 

![[8.3.34.jpg]]
Sender IP Address: Client
Sender MAC Address: Cleint
Target MAC Address: Everyone 

![[8.3.35.jpg]]
- arp.opcode == 1 - ARP Reply
- Arp.opcode == 2 - ARP request

If you get two reply for one command 
- There is possible to have two replys 
- There is a possible there is a Man in the middle 
	- Someone is sitting in the ARP looking for data 
![[8.3.36.jpg]]
- If you see this, Someone either change their IP Address or
- Man in the middle
- The reason for this, if there is an duplicate, there is a possibility that there is a man in the middle
	- If you have two routers with the same IP Address -> It will show this 
	- If you change your IP Address -> It will show this or it will show two different IP Address for different reply 
	- 

**Security Vulnerabilities associated with protocol**
ARP and Security
- If an attacker has access to a LAN, they can intercept traffic on its way to correct destination ("Good host")

**ARP Spoofing**
![[8.3.6 2.jpg]]
Note:  Arrow is pointing at[
- Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.47.2 (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) - also in used by 00:50:56:fd:2f:16 (frame301)]
	- Good host = [192.168.47.2] and correct MAC address is [00:50:56:fd:2f:16]
	- Attackers = MAC address: [00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1] 
	- Spoofing ARP message can be understood as [192.168.47.2] is at [00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1]
		- *Exposed IP Address* is at *Attackers MAC address* 

- Attacker can send a Spoofing ARP message to the LAN 
	- Directing all traffic intended for good host to attacker's MAC address
- After attacker sends the spoof ARP message,
	- All traffic originally destined for good host is intercepted by the attacker's device with Malicious MAC address
- This is known as **ARP cache poisonings** or **ARP spoofing**

**ARP cache Poisoning (spoofing)**: ARP request being sent to good host (intended IP Address) is bein sent to attacker's IP address instead
- Explanation: 
	- Hackers gather credentials and create request once they are able to become the Good host
	- Intercept classified or sensitive data such as usernames and passwords 

To counter ARP spoofing we can use Wireshark as it can detect and alert multiple MAC addresses associated with a single IP address 
- Note: Wireshark can detect and alert but will not take any actions 

**Static ARP Entries**
- Static ARP entries create permanent IP-to-MAC address mapping in the ARP cache 
	- Unlike Dynamic ARP entries, these can not be changed 
- Con: It is time consuming to manually enter and edit each IP-to-MAc mapping in the ARP cache as they are added and changed 
- ARP spoofing detection software program can be installed to identify and block poisoning attempts 
	- Expensive and require time to install, maintain, and update 

____
![[8.3.7.jpg]]
![[8.3.9.jpg]]
1. Open the packet capture provided to you and filter out for ARP activity.
- arp_packets.pcap 
	- Download -> In CMD -> cd ../Downloads -> unzip arp_packets.pcap 
	- Then go to file -> Wireshark -> Open -> 

2. Document the physical addresses found for each of the following IP addresses:
	- `192.168.47.1`
		- No.22 -> 00 : 50 : 56 : c0 : 00 : 08
	- `192.168.47.2`
		- No.25 -> 00 : 50 : 56 : fd : 2f : 16
	- `192.168.47.200`
		- No. 224 -> 00 : 0c : 29 : 0f : 71 : a3
	- `192.168.47.254`
		- No. 279 -> 00 : 50 : 56 : f9 : f5 : 54
			- Can also be found as Sender MAC Address: ...
			- Found on the bottom -> Address Resolution Protocol 

- Filters ARP replies; arp.opcode == 2
![[8.3.37.jpg]]

3. Further analyze the packet capture to determine if these IPs present any potential security vulnerabilities, and write a summary of your findings to provide to CompuCorp.
- Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.47.1 (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) - also in use by 00:50:56:c0:00:08 (frame 22) 
	- This is located in 00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1

Bonus
1. Name a few ways to protect against this vulnerability.
- Creating a static ARP entry in your server can help reduce the risk of ARP poisoning
- Third-party tools can identify and alert for potential ARP poisoning attacks.
2. Determine the primary vendor for the MAC addresses.
- Many web tools can assist with looking up the vendor associated with a MAC address.
- The web tool at aruljohn.com/mac.pl identifies all the MAC addresses vendors as VMWare.

___
**Ping**
![[8.3.38.jpg]]

Note: When enumerating, it is important to check if an external host is reachable
- To do this, we will need to use ping 
- **Ping:** Utility used to determine whether a host is operating and responding to echo request

Ping 8.8.8.8 (Google)
![[8.3.39.jpg]]
- ping -c 8
	- ping 8 times 
- 8.8.8.8
	- Google's IP Address 
- Claimed it failed 

![[8.3.40.jpg]]
- If any ping shows this 
	- It will tell you that it is working
	- time = # 
		- Tell you the speed 

**Internet control message protocol**
![[8.3.8.jpg]]
- **Internet Control message protocol ICMP**: A protocl that network device use to send error messages and operational information about whether a request service or host can be reached 

ping -c IP 

____
**Instructor Demo: Ping**


___
![[8.3.10.jpg]]
![[8.3.11.jpg]]
These Worked 
- `192.0.43.10`
- `107.191.96.2`
- `107.191.101.180`
- `23.226.229.4`
- `176.56.238.3`
![[8.3.41.jpg]]

- The three IPs that fail are:
    
    - `41.19.96.234`
    - `154.226.18.4`
    - `176.56.238.99`
![[8.3.42.jpg]]

Note: Ping can tell you that you can access the server
____
**What is traceroute**
Note: Ping indicates if a host is up or down, security professionals often need more info to determine why 

**Why is traceroute is important**
- While ping indicates if a host is up or down, we need more information to determine why

Ex of more information
![[8.3.12.jpg]]
Scenario: Company X employees were able to successfully ping their intranet from the United States office but unable to ping the exact same address from the Japan office
- More information is needed to  understand why the intranet is not accessible from Japan 
- Company X can better understand issue by finding out where is the request the failure occurred 

![[8.3.43.jpg]]
**Routing and redirections**
When data travels from a source to a destination, it does not travel in a straight path
- Path is redirected by many routers,
	- Routers connect different networks so their host can communicate 
- **hops**: Redirection of data transmission
- Optimal routing paths are determined based on the "shortest path"
	- Influenced by network topology 

Despite traveling "shortest path" communication between two  device can sometimes fail
- Resulting leaving network administrators unsure where a communication problem is located 
- Poor connectivity and latency issue are often due to packets being dropped along their routing paths 

Network administrator can use a cmd-line tool like traceroute to troubleshoot networking communication issues between two device and determine where the issue are in the hops

____
**Introduction to traceroute**
**Traceroute**: shows the route taken between two system across a network 
- List all routers (hops) the connection must pass through to get to the destination
- Network administrator can use traceroute to identify precisely where connectivity problems occur 

Traceroute uses
- **Display** how system are connected or map the network
- **Generate** baseline profiles of the network 
- **Diagnose** subpar network performance issue 
- Troubleshooting connectivity issue

**ICMP and Time to Live (TTL)**
**Time to Live (TTL)**: The ICMP header contain a field 
- TTL indicates how long a data packet can exist in a network
- TTL is Utilized as a decrementing hop counter 
- Every router that forwards the packet decrements (reduce) the TTL value by one 
Note: Similar to Ping, traceroute also use the ICMP protocol
- Shows time taken to travel across each of hops from source to destination 

![[8.3.13.jpg]]
- If starting TTL value of a data packet is face and the data travel across two routers, the TTL will drop to three 
	- When TTL count reaches 0;
		- Sends a time exceeded error message back to the source address
		- This prevents data from being stuck in an infinite loop if it cannot be delivered to the destination 
- Explanation: 
	- TTL or Time to live portray the maximum distance of ARP response before reaching an error.
		- Host A request ARP response but response was stopped at router F as it did not have enough TTL to connect to Router G 
			- At TTL = 0; sends and error code at Host A 

![[8.3.14.jpg]]
- ICMP time exceeded will go through multiple errors as they travel through multiple routers until they reach attended destination within the 'shortest route'

_____
**Instructor Demo: traceroute**
![[8.3.45.jpg]]
 $**tracert** (Windows)/ **traceroute domain.com** (linux)
- 1 -> Your IP
- 12 -> The number of hops 
- This is the one that works
- ms -> Milisecond -> >50 is bad, < 50 is good 

![[8.3.46.jpg]]
- This is not working
	- This will tell you that the network is going through comcast but it is unable to reach 41. 19. 96 .234

![[8.3.47.jpg]]
This is showing it is not working 
- It stop working at a certain location 
![[8.3.48.jpg]]
This sites shows it is data is transferring out but not reaching end destination 

___
Check Point: Studies the ARP on Layer 2 and pin and traceroute utilities from layer 3
____

**Layer 4: Transport**
![[8.3.17.jpg]]

![[8.3.49 1.jpg]]
**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: One of the most widely used protocols for data transmission 
- Connection-oriented protocol, meaning the server must acknowledge it has received the request from the client 
	- If recipient does not acknowledge the request, sender assume the request has not been received and will attempt to resend 
	- **TCP handshake:** Connection-oriented acknowledgement 
		- TCP HANDSHAKE WILL BE ASKED ON AN INTERVIEW

![[8.3.18.jpg]]
-  TCP ensure all data is transmitted without errors in correct order
	- Familiar protocol as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMTP 
- EX: Checking transaction history on an online banking website 
	- Use HTTPS (Protocol that runs over TCP)
		- Ensures that all request data from out banking transaction history has been transmitted from the bank's web server 
		- Banking customers need to trust the integrity of the data they are viewing
			- Its critical that banking data is complete and error-free

UDP - send information temporary - only good when ZOOM because it does not need to check if the video/ audio is working - it makes the connection faster but it is super bad when it comes with data 


**TCP three-way handshake:** Process of establishing a reliable connection to transmit data between devices
![[8.3.19.jpg]]
- Diagram of Three-way handshake
	- How to set up and how process of establish reliable connect to transmit data between work station and server
NOTE: THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST -> Network security/ administration job 

![[8.3.20.jpg]]
**SYN (synchronize)** -From Client to server 
- Client sends a SYN data packet to the server to determine if it is ready to open a connection 
	- Explanation: To see if they are ready to connect with server 

**SYN/ACK (synchronize/acknowledge) - From server to client**
- Server acknowledges or confirms receipts of the SYN packet
	- Explanation: Server accepting work station connection request

**ACK (acknowledge) - Client to server**
- client confirms recipes of SYN/ACK packet
	- Once the handshake is successfully complete, the data transmission can begin 
	- Explanation: Work station confirms accepts it's request, it sends data transmission

![[8.3.21.jpg]]
- Work Station sends termination package to server to close connection ->
- Server Acknowledge termination package -> Server Sends termination connection and package to work station -> 
- Work station accepts Termination package and process is complete

![[8.3.22.jpg]]
If Handshake was not done -> Need to retransmit data (When data seem suspicious) 
___
**User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** When it's not necessary for all data to reach the destination
![[8.3.23.jpg]]

What is the difference between UDP and TCP
- UDP is Connectionless
- TCP is connection

Which one is better between UDP and TCP
It depends; 
- TCP is better for transferring data
	- Slower 
- UDP is only good for Live action
	- Faster -> Does not check 


____
**Instructor Demo: TCP**
![[8.3.50 1.jpg]]
- Source - Tells you what computer interact with what webbrowser 
- Destination - tells you what website they interact 
- SYN package was sent on first line 

How do we find all SYN 
- on the bottom; 
	-  __?_ > flag -> Fin set to 0
	- Look for SYN 
		- tcp.syn == 1 
	- Look for destination on Ip and ack
		- destination.ip == ip AND tcp.ack == 1
			- This will tell you who started the conversation
				- Shows where the conflict coming from 

	

____
**Introduction to SYN Scan**
Ports are like "doors" to a network 
- Critical for security professional to be sure that these doors are not open to unauthorized users

___
![[8.3.24.jpg]]
![[8.3.30 1.jpg]]
Note: Looking at Transmission control protocol -> Flags -> SYN (1 = on, 0 = off)
on top- type tcp 
- You want to see only tcp

type tcp.flags.syn == 1
- IP address that tries to reach out/ responded 
- initating a connection, firestarter

type tcp.flags.syn == 2
- This will tell you that they accept the packet and they are ready to communicate 
- Acknowledge Packet 

![[5.3.51.jpg]]
- We used tcp.flags.syn == 1

![[5.3.52.jpg]]
Looking for termination 
- tcp.flags.fin == 1

![[5.3.53.jpg]]
We get the destination IP -> Search online securitytrails.com
